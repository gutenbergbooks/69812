<p>The aim of this book is to demonstrate the nutritious and appetising
possibilities of vegetable foods. Cattle are becoming so diseased that
apart from a humane revulsion against the consumption of meats in
daily food, man is being driven for his own welfare to seek purer food
substance. Any physical habit indulged in for generations is difficult
to overcome, and the transition period between daily meat eating, and
pure vegetarianism is a difficult one. We have endeavored to suggest
such a variety of tasty and nutritious foods as will materially aid in
making the change.</p>

<p>We do not claim this to be an exhaustive treatise on Vegetarian
Cookery; only a clear and practical aid in the better preparations of
some of the delicious products of the Vegetable Kingdom. Many children
show a natural dislike to meats, and Mothers are at a loss how to
supply them with proper nourishment when they reject the meat. Requests
have come to us for aid through this very fact; and was one of the

<p>Vegetarianism from a Theosophical standpoint involves a whole
philosophy of life. The short quotation on our title page well
expresses the theosophic concept of the Unity of life, and the law of
cause and effect which we call Karma. Life is fundamentally a unit,
and aught that works ill to any manifestation thereof has effect on
all. Through occult science we are taught a very practical lesson
of direct benefit to the individual, by a diet free from blood. As
clearly stated in Annie Besant’s manual on “Man and his Bodies,” man
molds these instruments of his will, or true self. These bodies are
but instruments; in no sense the man himself; and these instruments or
bodies are finely responsive to the operator, or true self, only as
they are purified and harmonized. Gross foods, and gluttony make gross
bodies, not only physical, but astral as well. For the astral bodies
feed on the subtle emanations of the foods supplying nutriment to the
physical encasement. If, through the consumption of meats we feed the
astral on the emanations of blood or animal life, we intensify the
gross desire-nature of the astral man, intensify the passional-nature,
and at death, when the physical body is cast aside as a discarded
garment, the dense, gross, astral body is held to corresponding planes
in the realm of the astral;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span> thus the purgatory of the Roman church
becomes a very real and uncomfortable experience. If, on the contrary,
clean habits of life have purified the astral body, when it is
liberated at the hour of death from the prison house of flesh it is not
of the same degree of density as the lower astral planes, and it passes
on to the sunlit meadows of that world and away from its slums.</p>

<p>Alcohol has also a most pernicious effect on the astral vehicle, and
for that reason is eliminated from the food of the occultist. It is a
great mistake to give to the perishing, alcohol, or narcotics, as it
has really a more serious effect on the out-going astral than on the
physical encasement. When man learns to live on clean food, to have
clean habits and to think clean, generous thoughts, there is naught in
all this wonderful universe that he need fear.</p>

</div>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="SOUPS">SOUPS.</h2>


<h3>SOUP STOCK.</h3>

<p>Any nuts with herbs dried and ground will nicely flavor and enrich
stock.</p>


<h3>STOCK FOR CLEAR SOUPS.</h3>

<p>Place four onions in large kettle with a gallon of water, let boil
steadily two hours, then add one carrot, two small turnips, two
parsnips, three bay leaves, one head of celery (if celery leaves cannot
be had a saltspoonful of celery seeds may be used), one-eighth head
of cabbage. Let boil four hours; strain. This should make a gallon of
strong stock.</p>


<h3>TOMATO BOUILLON.</h3>

<p>Put one quart of tomatoes, with one and a half quarts of water, in
kettle over the fire; add one tablespoonful of chopped onion, two bay
leaves, four whole cloves, one level teaspoonful of celery seed and
a half teaspoonful of pepper. Cover and cook twenty minutes. Strain
through a sieve. Beat the whites of two eggs<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span> until partly light, add
them to the tomato, and boil rapidly for five minutes. Strain through
two thicknesses of cheese cloth. Reheat, season with two teaspoonfuls
of salt and serve with croutons.</p>


<h3>JULIENNE SOUP.</h3>

<p>Boil tender, not soft, one small potato, one small carrot, one half
cupful of green peas (canned peas can be used), and one small head of
celery, if in season; if in summer, asparagus heads will do. Cut the
large vegetables into small dice, and add one quart of the clear stock.
Take the yolks of two eggs, whipping them up with one tablespoonful of
milk with salt to taste, put in a crockery cup and set in steamer; let
cook until solid; set away to chill, then cut in small dice or fancy
shapes and add to the soup.</p>


<h3>MACARONI SOUP.</h3>

<p>One-third package of Macaroni, or Spaghetti; cook in boiling water,
salted to taste, until tender, then drain quickly and add one quart of

<h3>TORONTO BISQUE.</h3>

<p>Place a sauce pan, with half a cupful of fine chopped onion, the same
of carrot and celery, over the fire; cover with boiling water; cook
five minutes; drain off the water. Melt one tablespoonful of butter in
a saucepan, add the parboiled vegetables; cover and cook ten minutes,
stirring often; then add one heaping teaspoonful of flour, stir and
cook two minutes, add<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span> one cupful of canned tomatoes, and one quart of
boiling water, cook fifteen minutes. Shortly before serving rub the
bisque through a sieve; mix the yolk of two eggs with half a cupful of
cream; add it to the bisque, and stir for a few minutes over the fire.
In the meantime cook two ounces of macaroni in salted water thirty-five
minutes; drain and rinse it off with cold water; cut the macaroni into
small pieces the size of a white bean; add one cupful of this macaroni
to the bisque and serve.</p>


<h3>TOMATO SOUP.</h3>

<p>To one can of tomatoes add one pint of water, four peppercorns, one
half bay leaf, four cloves, and a bit of mace; cook until the tomatoes
are soft enough to strain. After straining add two teaspoonfuls of
sugar, one teaspoonful of salt, one fourth teaspoonful of soda; thicken
with two tablespoonfuls of butter and three tablespoonfuls of flour
blended together.</p>


<h3>CREAM OF TOMATO.</h3>

<p>To one half can of tomatoes, add one scant tablespoonful of finely
chopped onion, and three spikes of celery, cook until tender, then
strain through a wire sieve; season to taste, add soda the size of
a pea. Scald one quart of milk, mix one teaspoonful of butter with
heaping teaspoonful of flour, dissolve in warm milk and stir into the
scalding milk; add to the strained tomato stock just before serving;
don’t let it stand after milk is added. Serve with crackers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span></p>


<h3>DUTCH SOUP.</h3>

<p>Take one bay leaf, one half can of tomatoes, one half can of corn, one
medium sized onion, chopped; two heads of celery, cut fine (or one half
teaspoonful of celery seed); one half cupful of rice, one half cupful
of oatmeal, one carrot, cut in dice, one eighth head of cabbage, cut
fine, one small turnip, cut fine, gallon, or more, of cold water, with
salt to taste. Cook gently until all vegetables are thoroughly tender.
Very nice served plain, or with dumplings. This soup is a hearty
luncheon in itself.</p>


<h3>CREAM OF POTATO.</h3>

<p>To one head of celery, cut fine, add one teaspoonful of chopped onion,
one large, or two medium sized potatoes, sliced; cook until you can
mash through a wire sieve; then add one quart of scalding milk, one
half cupful of cream, and thicken to a cream with buttered flour. Serve

of flour, add pinch of salt, one even teaspoonful baking powder, one
tablespoonful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span> cream, and water enough to make soft dough; do not
knead, mould into small lumps, size of walnuts, and drop into soup
as soon as the soup comes to a boil. The dumplings take about eight
minutes to cook, and the kettle should be kept covered all the time.
The soup needs to be carefully watched that it does not boil over or
burn; it is well to lift the kettle free from the stove every three or
four minutes, giving it a little twirl, but do not lift the cover until
the eight minutes are passed, for sudden reduction of temperature may
make the dumplings heavy.</p>

teaspoonful of flour blended smooth with water, stir into the strained
mixture, and put soup back on the fire, letting it come to a good boil.
The flour is added to keep the soup an even creamy thickness. Serve
with croutons.</p>

cupful of soft butter, stir it into the boiling soup until it thickens;

cheese, celery, onion, and tomato, another variety.</p>


<h3>VEGETABLE HASH.</h3>

<p>Of cooked and chopped vegetables, use one carrot, one blood beet, two
turnips, two quarts of finely sliced potatoes, one onion, and a stalk
of celery; one sprig of parsley; put them in a stew pan, cover tight,
and set in the oven. When thoroughly heated pour over a gravy of drawn
butter and cream. Stir together and serve.</p>


<h3>NUT CROQUETTES.</h3>

<p>Shell and grind one pound of English walnuts, add one teaspoonful of
salt, and the juice of half a lemon,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span> one tablespoonful of chopped
parsley, a dash of cayenne pepper; mix thoroughly. Place one cupful of
milk in double boiler; rub one tablespoonful of softened butter with
two tablespoonfuls of flour; when the cream is hot, stir in the flour
and butter; cook until it thickens; season lightly.</p>

<p>Then turn the thickened cream into the nut mixture; have ready a well
beaten egg and whip in; mix all together thoroughly. Set away to cool;
when cold form into shapely rolls, dip in bread crumbs, then in beaten
egg, again in bread crumbs, and fry quickly in hot fat. Be sure the fat
is at right temperature,—see “Important Notes.”</p>


<h3>BISCUIT PATES.</h3>

<p>Make a nice light baking powder biscuit. Have ready, when the biscuits
are done, one cupful of small mushrooms cooked tender and cut fine,
dressed with one half cupful of cream, mixed with juice of mushrooms,
and thickened with one teaspoonful of flour, blended with teaspoonful
of butter; season to taste with salt and pepper. Take a thin slice off
of the bottom of the biscuit, dig out the center, leaving reasonably
thick walls, put little piece of butter in the shell and fill with
mushrooms dressing; serve at once. Stale biscuit may be used by
toasting them a few minutes in a hot oven after they have been hollowed
out. These are crisp and some prefer them to fresh biscuit.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="MUSHROOMS">MUSHROOMS.</h2>
</div>

<h3>GRILLED MUSHROOMS.</h3>

<p>Prepared in this way the mushrooms must be large. After washing and
peeling, score the tops with a knife and lay them for one hour in a
pickle of oil, salt, pepper and lemon juice. Place them, tops down, on
a close-barred gridiron and broil over a clear, slow fire. Serve on
toast with a sauce made as follows:</p>

<p>Chop the stalks and pieces of mushrooms that have broken in the washing
and stew in broth for ten minutes with a little minced parsley and
onion. Beat the yolk of one egg with a gill of cream and add slowly to
the sauce. Stir the whole until hot without boiling and pour it over
the toast.</p>


<h3>ESCALOPED MUSHROOMS.</h3>

<p>Put the mushrooms in a buttered baking-dish with alternate layers of
crumbs, seasoning each layer plentifully with butter; add salt, pepper
and a gill of cream or gravy. Bake twenty minutes, keeping covered
while in the oven.</p>


<h3>MUSHROOM PIE.</h3>

<p>Line a baking dish with rich crust. Drain the liquor from a can of
small mushrooms, slice the mushrooms, add one cupful of cream, or rich
milk, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span> tablespoonful of butter, to juice of mushrooms. Season to
taste and thicken with tablespoonful of flour blended with butter; add
the mushrooms, fill in the baking dish, cover with top crust and bake a
rich brown. Brown sauce may be used if preferred.</p>


<h3>AUNT SUSAN’S MUSHROOM PIE.</h3>

<p>Line a deep pudding pan with rich paste; fill two thirds full of
mushrooms (if raw they must be stewed a few minutes first), make a
gravy of flour rubbed very smooth with thick cream, or with butter
and milk, thin with boiling water, season with salt, pepper and soup
powder, pour over the mushrooms, cover with paste and bake.</p>


<h3>BAKED MUSHROOMS.</h3>

<p>Toast for each person a large slice of bread and spread over with rich
sweet cream; lay on each slice, head downward, a mushroom, or if small,
more than one; season and fill each with as much cream as it will hold.
Place over each a custard cup, pressing well down to the toast; set in
a moderate oven and cook fifteen minutes. Do not remove the cups for
five minutes after they come from the oven, as thereby the flavor of
the mushroom is preserved in its entirety.</p>


<h3>STEWED MUSHROOMS.</h3>

<p>Drain off the juice from a can of small mushrooms; put a heaping
tablespoonful of butter into a frying pan; add two tablespoonfuls of
flour and brown well, stirring all the time; then pour in the juice of
mushrooms<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span> with water enough to make a thin gravy; season with salt,
pepper, and soup powder; add mushrooms and stew a few minutes, then
serve.</p>


<h3>MUSHROOMS IN WHITE SAUCE.</h3>

<p>For stewing, the smaller mushrooms are preferable. Carefully peel the
tops, cut the ends of the stalks level, wash and drain in colander.
They should be stewed, till tender, in as little water as possible.
When thoroughly cooked, add a pint of cream, or new milk, and thicken
in usual way with flour blended in melted butter.</p>


<h3>MUSHROOMS WITH LEMON.</h3>

<p>Use the small canned mushrooms, separate the mushrooms from the liquor,
put them, with one tablespoonful of butter in saucepan; add one
tablespoonful of lemon juice, a pinch of white pepper, and one quarter
of a teaspoonful of salt; place the saucepan over a slow fire and cook
gently fifteen minutes, then serve.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="EGGS">EGGS.</h2>
</div>

<h3>CURRIED EGGS, NO. 1.</h3>

<p>Put into saucepan two tablespoonfuls of butter, add one half
teaspoonful onion juice; cook slowly till the onion begins to color;
then add one tablespoonful flour and one teaspoonful curry powder;
when perfectly smooth add three fourths of a cupful of clear stock and
one half cupful of cream; cook for five minutes, stirring constantly;
season with salt and pepper. Cut six hard boiled eggs into halves
lengthwise; strain the sauce over them and let stand on the stove a few
minutes till thoroughly heated. Serve on thin squares of toast.</p>


<h3>CURRIED EGGS, NO. 2.</h3>

<p>Boil half a dozen eggs hard and let them get cold. Fry in butter two
large onions cut in thin slices, and let them get quite brown, season
these with pepper and salt, and add a pint of boiling water; when
the onions have stewed for a little while, put in a cupful of milk
thickened with arrowroot, or flour, and flavor with curry powder, let
it simmer, then put in the eggs cut in halves, making them hot, but
do not let them boil. The amount of curry powder used is a matter of
taste; garnish the dish with boiled rice, and serve very hot.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span></p>


<h3>BAKED EGGS.</h3>

<p>Butter gem pans and line with fine, buttered, bread crumbs. Break one
egg carefully into each pan, season with bits of pepper, salt and
butter, cover lightly with buttered bread crumbs, and bake in oven
until delicate brown.</p>


<h3>SCRAMBLED EGGS.</h3>

<p>Break the eggs into a bowl and beat moderately light; add cream in
proportion of one tablespoonful to every two eggs; season to taste.
Have one tablespoonful of butter melted in hot frying pan and pour into
the mixture. Stir until cooked solid, turn on hot platter and serve at
once with toast.</p>


<h3>SHIRRED EGGS.</h3>

<p>Set a saucer on the stove—the heavy japanese ware stands the heat
best—and put in it a teaspoonful of butter, when hot break two eggs
into the dish, let cook until they bubble, and begin to set. Serve in
the dish in which they are cooked, slipping the saucer on to a small
plate. Serve at once.</p>


<h3>HARD BOILED EGGS.</h3>

<p>The eggs should be placed in boiling water, then set where they will
simmer, rather than boil, and be left for fifteen minutes; the yolks
will be dry and fine. To make them peel easily slip at once into cold
water on removing from the fire.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span></p>


<h3>LYONAISE EGGS.</h3>

<p>Put one half tablespoonful butter in sauce pan, add one teaspoonful
onion juice, cook slowly five minutes. Add one tablespoonful flour
and, when well mixed, add one and one half cupfuls milk, stir till it
thickens, season with salt and pepper, pour the sauce in a bake-dish,
and break six eggs onto the sauce. Sprinkle quite thickly with bread
crumbs, put bits of butter over all, and set in the oven for three or
four minutes.</p>


<h3>EGGS WITH MUSHROOMS.</h3>

<p>Trim and peel the mushrooms; put them in stew-pan with butter, and cook
until tender, season to taste. Place in shallow dish pouring the butter
over them, then break over them eggs enough to cover, sprinkle thickly
with bread crumbs and add bits of butter, place in hot oven long enough
to set the eggs. Do not let the eggs harden; four or five minutes is
the time usually required. Serve at once.</p>


<h3>SAVORY EGGS.</h3>

<p>Fry slices of Spanish onions until a delicate brown; add a
tablespoonful of chopped parsley, pepper and salt, blend fat with
tablespoonful of flour; add a pint of hot milk. Have ready some hard
boiled eggs, quarter, and heat in the prepared sauce. Serve on toast.</p>


<h3>FRICASSEED EGGS.</h3>

<p>Boil the eggs till hard, take them out of the shells and arrange on a
platter either in halves, or the yolks<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span> whole and whites cut in dice;
make a rich white sauce and pour over them, garnish the dish with
parsley.</p>


<h3>EGGS FORCED.</h3>

<p>Boil the number of eggs required; throw into cold water to chill; peel,
and cut crosswise, take out the yolks, being careful not to break the
whites. Rub the yolks with tablespoonful of butter (if six eggs are
used), add two tablespoonfuls of cooked, chopped, mushrooms, pepper,
salt, and one tablespoonful of chopped parsley; heat this mixture and
beat it to a paste. Stuff with it the whites of the eggs and serve cold
on bed of cress.</p>


<h3>EGG CUTLETS.</h3>

<p>For each cutlet allow one hard boiled egg, chopped fine, a
tablespoonful of bread crumbs, the same quantity of grated cheese, a
pinch of curry powder, pepper and salt; mix the whole with the beaten
yolk of a raw egg and shape like cutlet; dip in white of egg and bread
crumbs and fry brown; serve very hot.</p>


<h3>ROASTED EGGS.</h3>

<p>Fresh eggs well roasted are considered by some to be much richer than
boiled eggs. Eggs may be roasted in the oven or in hot ashes. Care
should be taken to turn them, where the heat is unequal.</p>


<h3>EGGS IN CREAM.</h3>

<p>Put half a cupful, or more, of cream into a shallow earthen dish, and
place the dish in pan of boiling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span> water. When the cream is hot, break
in as many eggs as the bottom of the dish will hold, and cook until
well set, basting them occasionally over the top with the hot cream,
season to taste, and serve promptly.</p>


<h3>ESCALOPED EGGS.</h3>

<p>Boil six eggs fifteen minutes, the water should simmer, rather than
boil; then slip the eggs into cold water for a moment, to make them
peel easily, remove the shells and set aside to cool. Make a white
sauce of rich milk thickened with butter and flour, seasoned to
taste. Remove the whites of eggs and chop; cream the yolks with one
half cupful of cream and add to white sauce. Stir in the chopped up
whites, and add a teaspoonful of chopped parsley; place in baking dish,
sprinkle bread crumbs and bits of butter over the top and set in hot
oven just long enough to brown delicately.</p>


<h3>POACHED EGGS, SPANISH STYLE.</h3>

<p>Heat an earthen pan slowly and melt in it a tablespoonful of butter;
add a teaspoonful of salt, a smaller quantity of pepper and a small
onion minced very fine; or in place of the onion, use parsley, and
sweet herbs, or a combination of all together as you prefer. Drop in
the eggs one at a time; do not stir, but let them brown a little; turn
carefully and brown on the other side. In Spain and Mexico they are
served in the dish in which they are cooked, and as hot as possible.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span></p>


<h3>SWISS EGGS.</h3>

<p>Cover the bottom of a dish with two ounces of fresh butter and on this
scatter grated cheese; drop the eggs upon the cheese without breaking
the yolks, season to taste. Pour over the eggs a little cream and
sprinkle with about two ounces of grated cheese; set in a moderate oven
for ten or fifteen minutes.</p>


<h3>FRENCH OMELET (PLAIN).</h3>

<p>Beat the yolks of six eggs to a cream, and beat whites to a stiff
froth, add two tablespoonfuls of cream, or rich milk, to the yolks,
season to taste, whip in the beaten whites lightly. Have omelet pan
well oiled with butter and moderately hot; cook slowly until browned
slightly on the bottom, then set pan in upper grate in hot oven. Serve
on a platter garnished with parsley.</p>


<h3>DRESSED OMELETS.</h3>

<p>A nice variety can be given omelets by filling supplied just before
folding.</p>


<h3>TOMATO DRESSING.</h3>

<p>Five tomatoes stewed down, and seasoned with salt, pepper and butter.
Spread on omelet just before folding.</p>


<h3>OMELET, WITH FRENCH PEAS.</h3>

<p>Heat and drain one can of peas, season with salt, pepper and butter.
Cover the platter and serve omelet on peas.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span></p>


<h3>MUSHROOM FILLING.</h3>

<p>If fresh mushrooms are used, select the small variety; peel and slice
them, stew until tender in butter; season to taste and spread on omelet
before folding.</p>


<h3>FOAMY OMELET (SWEET).</h3>

<p>Beat the yolks of six eggs to a cream, add one half cupful of cream,
one tablespoonful of sugar. Whip the whites to a stiff froth, and add
one half to the mixture; have frying pan moderately hot, melt one
teaspoonful of butter in pan; be careful not to brown, and pour in
the mixture. Cook carefully, lifting pan from fire frequently so it
will not scorch on the bottom; when nearly set, pour over the rest of
whites of eggs, and sprinkle with powdered sugar, then set in oven
until whites of eggs set; have ready a hot platter, slip omelet on to
platter, lay spoonfuls of jelly on omelet and double quickly. Serve at
once. This omelet without sweetening is very nice with savory dressing,
such as minced herbs heated in butter.</p>


<h3>BREAD OMELET.</h3>

<p>Crumble a cupful of stale bread and soak in half a teacupful of milk.
Then beat quite smooth, and add half a teaspoonful of salt and five
beaten eggs. Butter a shallow pudding dish well, pour in the mixture,
and bake in an oven about ten minutes, serving at once in the same
dish, as it falls quickly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span></p>


<h3>VEGETABLE OMELET.</h3>

<p>Chop an onion finely, together with two crisp heads of lettuce,
season with salt and pepper, and stir in six well beaten eggs, add
three tablespoonfuls of cream. Pour into hot, buttered spider, and
when thickened, but not hardened, fold over and serve on hot platter.
Parsley may be used, if preferred, in place of lettuce.</p>


<h3>CHEESE OMELET, NO. 1.</h3>

<p>Break three eggs into a basin; whip them till well mixed; add pepper
and salt, and two ounces of grated cheese; melt one tablespoonful of
butter in frying pan; when the butter is quite hot pour the mixture
into the pan; as soon as it begins to set, draw the thickening portion
from the bottom of pan with a silver fork, letting the liquid substance
cover the pan, do not stir; repeat this operation until it is all
sufficiently cooked; then turn onto a heated platter, garnished with
parsley, or cress.</p>


<h3>CHEESE OMELET, NO. 2.</h3>

<p>Mix to a smooth batter three tablespoonfuls of flour with half a pint
of milk. Beat together four eggs, a little salt and one fourth of a
pound of old cheese grated. Add these to the flour and milk and mix
all, beating briskly for several minutes. Put three ounces of butter on
a frying pan, and when it is boiling hot pour in the mixture and cook
to a nice brown on both sides, turning carefully. Serve on a hot dish.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span></p>


<h3>EGG AND ASPARAGUS.</h3>

<p>Cut about two dozen stalks of asparagus into inch lengths and boil
tender. Drain, pour over a cupful of drawn butter; stir until hot, turn
into a baking dish. Break about six eggs on top, put a bit of butter on
each, with salt, and pepper; put into a quick oven until the eggs are
“set.”</p>


<h3>DEVILLED EGGS.</h3>

<p>Boil the eggs for twenty minutes, remove the shells, cut each egg in
half without breaking the whites; take out the yolks and pound them
in a mortar, adding cayenne, salt and curry powder. Stuff the whites
with this paste and join the eggs to their original shape. Cut off just
sufficient of each broad end to enable them to stand, and arrange them
thus on a dish in a bed of cress or parsley.</p>


<h3>EGGS ON TOAST.</h3>

<p>Put one tablespoonful of butter in a chaffing dish, and when bubbling
add one tablespoonful of flour, one half teaspoonful of salt, one half
saltspoonful of pepper, and, gradually, one cupful of milk. Add the
whites of three hard boiled eggs, chopped fine. When hot, pour over
three slices of toast. Rub the yolks through a strainer over all and
garnish with parsley.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="SAVORY_SAUCES_AND_GRAVIES">SAVORY SAUCES AND GRAVIES.</h2>
</div>


<p>Nut butter is an excellent substitute for meat essence in gravies,
stocks, and sauces. It should be used in the proportion of one
tablespoonful to one quart of water.</p>


<h3>BROWN SAUCE.</h3>

<p>Heat a pint of thin cream; when boiling add a tablespoonful of flour,
browned in the oven and rubbed to a smooth paste with a little cold
milk; salt to taste; cook thoroughly for ten minutes; then add one
cupful of hot, stewed, strained tomato. Beat thoroughly.</p>


<h3>TOMATO SAUCE, NO. 1.</h3>

<p>Melt one tablespoonful butter, add one tablespoonful of chopped
onion, fry until delicate brown; then add one tablespoonful of flour;
gradually pour in one cupful of clear soup stock and one half cupful of
strained juice of tomato. Season to taste, and cook until it thickens.
Nut or dairy butter may be used.</p>


<h3>TOMATO SAUCE, NO. 2.</h3>

<p>Put one half can of tomatoes, one cupful of water, two cloves, two
allspice berries, two pepper corns, two sprigs of parsley, one
teaspoonful of mixed herbs, over to boil in granite saucepan; fry one
tablespoonful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span> of chopped onion in one tablespoonful of butter till a
delicate brown; then add tomato mixture and one heaping tablespoonful
of corn starch that has been dissolved in cold water. Simmer ten
minutes, add one half teaspoonful of salt, and one half saltspoonful of
pepper, add a dash of cayenne, if liked. Strain.</p>


<h3>WHITE SAUCE.</h3>

<p>To one pint of milk add one heaping tablespoonful of flour blended with
one tablespoonful of melted butter; boil until it thickens, salt to
taste, add one half cupful of cream. If too thick, thin with hot milk.</p>


<h3>CHEESE SAUCE.</h3>

<p>Flavor white sauce by adding grated cheese, and stir until the cheese
is quite melted.</p>


<h3>DUTCH SAUCE.</h3>

<p>To four ounces of butter add the well beaten yolks of three eggs, a
teaspoonful of flour, a dessertspoonful of lemon juice and salt to
taste; put in double boiler and stir gently until it thickens; do not
let it boil or it will curdle. This sauce is very nice with asparagus
or cauliflower.</p>


<h3>DRAWN BUTTER.</h3>

<p>One half cupful of butter, rubbed well with two tablespoonfuls of
flour; put into saucepan with about one pint of boiling water, stir
constantly until well melted. Add one tablespoonful of chopped parsley.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span></p>


<h3>BUTTER SAUCE.</h3>

<p>Season a cupful of flour with pepper, nutmeg, and cloves. Mix it with
water into a thin paste, and work in a piece of butter about the size
of an egg. Put the paste into a pan over the fire, and boil it for a
quarter of an hour, then take it off, and add some fresh butter in
small portions at a time, continually stirring the contents, to prevent
the butter from rising to the surface. Afterwards add lemon juice to
flavor, and mix thoroughly. This sauce may be used with almost any
vegetable. Another way of making butter sauce sometimes called oiled
butter, which is generally liked, is to take as much fresh butter as
will be wanted, and melt it, but do not let it brown. Skim it, pour it
out, let it rest a minute, then drain it from the curd at the bottom,
and serve.</p>


<h3>BROWN BUTTER GRAVY.</h3>

<p>Take one bay leaf, and a teaspoonful of chopped onion and simmer
fifteen minutes in one pint of water. Brown two tablespoonfuls of
flour. Put one heaping tablespoonful of butter in frying-pan, melt,
browning slightly, add flour, then the strained water that is flavored
with onion and bay leaf; let boil, if too thick add more hot water.
Salt and pepper to taste.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="SALAD_DRESSINGS_AND_SALADS">SALAD DRESSINGS, AND SALADS.</h2>
</div>

<h3>CREAM DRESSING.</h3>

<p>To one pint of boiling cream, add two ounces of flour, stirred to a
smooth paste with two ounces of butter; cook two minutes. Remove from
sauce pan and add one ounce more of butter, stirring until cool and
perfectly mixed; then season to taste with lemon juice, salt, pepper,
and mustard (blending the mustard first in a little lemon juice). Add
sliced olives; or, if preferred, use one tablespoonful of chopped
parsley and one half teaspoonful of finely chopped onion; the olives
are best with cabbage, and onion and parsley with mixed salads.</p>


<h3>PLAIN DRESSING.</h3>

<p>Beat one egg very light; add one tablespoonful of vinegar and cook in
double boiler until thick; place one tablespoonful of butter in a bowl
and pour the hot custard over it; beat until smooth, then add mustard
and salt to taste—one half teaspoonful of mustard, and saltspoonful
of salt is the usual proportion,—with half a teaspoonful of sugar to
blend. Set away to cool. Just before using, add sufficient sweet cream
to thin to the consistency of rich cream.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span></p>


<h3>MAYONAISE DRESSING.</h3>

<p>To the yolks of two eggs add a scant teaspoonful of mustard, equal
quantity of salt, and a dash of cayenne pepper, stir, then add, very
slowly almost drop by drop, one teacupful of olive oil. The mixture
should be as thick as butter, then add one tablespoonful of lemon
juice, if too thick, thin with sweet cream. For cabbage or potato
salads it is well to add one half cup of sweet cream, while for tomato,
aspic or plain, no cream should be used.</p>


<h3>FRENCH DRESSING.</h3>

<p>Mix one half teaspoonful of salt, with one half saltspoonful of pepper
and two tablespoonfuls of lemon juice; then add slowly, stirring
briskly, one half cupful of oil. Very nice for plain salads.</p>


<h3>COOKED SALAD DRESSING.</h3>

<p>Mix one tablespoonful of sugar, one teaspoonful of mustard, one
teaspoonful of salt, a speck of cayenne and the yolk of one egg; add
two tablespoonfuls of melted butter and one half cupful of milk. Stir
over boiling water until it thickens. Take from the fire and add the

of sugar, one dessertspoonful of melted butter, one half teaspoonful
of salt and the yolk of one egg; add one cupful of milk and cook in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>
double boiler until it thickens; stirring all the while. When thick add
lemon juice or vinegar to taste. This dressing can be kept any length
of time by bottling, not necessary to seal.</p>


<h3>SALAD CREAM.</h3>

<p>Heat one half cupful of vinegar and one half cupful of sugar. When very
hot add one half cupful of sour cream into which the yolks of two eggs
have been beaten. Stir well, remove from the fire and then chill before
using.</p>

<p>Very nice on cabbage salad.</p>


<h3>SPRING SALAD.</h3>

<p>In a salad bowl put a layer of fresh watercress, then a layer of thinly
sliced cucumbers, then a layer of tomatoes with a teaspoonful of
chopped chives. Repeat the process and put a border of watercress round
the bowl. When ready to serve pour on a French dressing and toss until
well mingled.</p>


<h3>STUFFED TOMATO SALAD.</h3>

<p>Select good sized, smooth, solid tomatoes, scald and skin quickly,
slip into ice-water to chill, then carefully remove center without
breaking under part; remove seed pulp with your finger, then fill
with a chopped mixture of onion, cucumber, parsley, and cress; cover
with mayonaise dressing and serve on platter garnished with lettuce
leaves, or parsley. One should use judgment in regard to any mixture
given in receipt of this nature, and omit any article not pleasing to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>
individual tastes, for instance some prefer to omit parsley, others do
not like onion, etc.</p>


<h3>PLAIN TOMATO SALAD.</h3>

<p>Choose smooth round medium sized tomatoes, scald, and skin quickly. Set
away to chill, serve on lettuce leaves with thick mayonaise dressing.</p>


<h3>TOMATO ASPIC.</h3>

<p>To one quart of strained tomato juice, add one bay leaf, one
teaspoonful of chopped onion, and one teaspoonful of salt; let boil ten
minutes, strain through fine sieve, or cheese cloth. Set back on stove
and thicken with two or more tablespoonfuls of cornstarch, previously
dissolved in one third cup of cold water; let boil until clear, turn
into wet mould, and set away to chill. Serve on lettuce leaves with
thick mayonaise dressing.</p>


<h3>SUMMER SALAD.</h3>

<p>Take two small heads of nice tender lettuce; tear, do not cut, add one
pint of wax or string beans, that have been cooked till tender. Add
one medium sized cucumber, sliced thin, and one young onion, two hard

and slice one medium sized cucumber; cut fine one third cupful of
parsley; wash one bunch of water cress; clean six crisp round radishes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>
but do not pare, slice thin; slice very thin as much onion as suits
your taste, mix all together and dress with oil, lemon juice, salt and
cayenne pepper, mixed thoroughly until the lemon cuts the oil; this
result is obtained more quickly if your oil is thoroughly chilled and
is added slowly to the lemon juice and salt; add pepper last. This is a
delicate and delicious summer salad.</p>


<h3>STRING BEAN SALAD.</h3>

<p>String, wash and break into inch lengths one quart of tender beans,
boil in salted water until tender; drain thoroughly, then mix with one
cupful of French dressing, and let stand until cold. Serve on lettuce
leaves, and just before sending to the table add a little more dressing.</p>


<h3>LIMA BEAN SALAD.</h3>

<p>If fresh beans are used boil until tender in salted water; in winter
use the California dried beans and soak over night, then boil gently
till tender; drain, and when cold sprinkle with salt and pepper; add
one tablespoonful of chopped parsley and a few drops of onion juice;
pour over a French dressing, or, if you prefer, a mayonaise; arrange on
crisp lettuce leaves, garnish with hard boiled eggs.</p>

leaves and sliced lemon.</p>


<h3>POTATO SALAD NO. 1.</h3>

<p>Cut cold boiled potatoes into small dice, add one tablespoonful of
onion juice, or tablespoonful of chopped onion (if onion flavor is
liked). Sprinkle with celery seed and dress with oil, salt, cayenne,
and lemon juice, the same as Italian salad.</p>

<p>Slice five or six cold boiled potatoes, one cucumber, a dozen olives,
and three small onions, into a bowl; add half a teacupful of capers,
a few chopped meats<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span> of English walnuts, and cover with mayonaise
dressing.</p>


<h3>BEET SALAD.</h3>

<p>Boil small sized beets till tender in salted water; remove the skin,
scoop out the center—leaving the sides one quarter of an inch thick;
pour over them a French dressing to which has been added a few drops
of onion juice; stand aside for an hour. Chop up four stalks of crisp
celery and one cucumber; add one tablespoonful of chopped parsley,
one half teaspoonful of onion juice and the chopped pieces of the
beet taken from the centers; mix all together, drain the beets, and
fill with the mixture; arrange on water cress, pour over it a French
dressing.</p>


<h3>CABBAGE SALAD.</h3>

<p>Select a solid, white, head of cabbage, cut in half; then slice as
finely as possible, with sharp knife or cabbage cutter the quantity
desired; let stand in cold salted water for half an hour, drain

added a dozen sliced olives, and a teaspoonful of chopped parsley.</p>


<h3>SALAD OF GRAPE FRUIT AND WALNUTS.</h3>

<p>Remove the pulp carefully from the grape fruit and add walnut meats
in proportion of one half to the quantity of pulp; make a dressing of
three tablespoonfuls of oil, with salt to taste, a dash of cayenne
pepper,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span> and one tablespoonful of lemon juice; pour this over the grape
fruit and walnuts, and serve very cold.</p>


<h3>A SWEET SALAD.</h3>

<p>Slice bananas, and place in pudding, or salad dish, alternate layers
of banana and strawberries, covering each layer liberally with sugar.
Cover with whipped cream. Instead of strawberries, oranges may be used.</p>


<h3>ORANGE SALAD.</h3>

<p>Beat the yolks of four eggs until very thick and light colored, then
beat into them, gradually, one cupful of sifted, powdered sugar and
half a level teaspoonful of salt; beat until the sugar is dissolved.
Next add the juice of two lemons and beat again. Peel and slice thin,
six bananas. Peel four oranges, cutting close to the pulp, pick out the
seeds, and slice oranges across in thin slices. Put into a deep glass
dish a layer of bananas, then of the dressing, then of the orange, then
again a layer of each in the same order with banana on the top, and
pour the remainder of the dressing over it. Set on ice and serve very
cold.</p>


<h3>SALMAGUNDI.</h3>

<p>Cut into neat strips three cold boiled potatoes, one carrot, one large
beet, one half of a small cauliflower—all boiled and cold. Pile in
attractive order on a flat dish; chop a cucumber pickle fine and strew

<h2 class="nobreak" id="VEGETABLES">VEGETABLES.</h2>

</div>
<h3>CREAMED VEGETABLES.</h3>

<p>Take equal quantities of carrots, turnips, asparagus, peas and
cauliflowers. With a vegetable scoop cut the carrots and turnips into
pieces a quarter of an inch square, or turn them into the shapes of
olives, filberts, &amp;c. Divide the cauliflowers and asparagus into small,
neat pieces. Cook the vegetables separately in plenty of water; when
tender drain and dry them; cover with white sauce and serve.</p>


<h3>ESCALOPED ONIONS, CAULIFLOWER, OR ASPARAGUS.</h3>

<p>Boil until tender, then put in baking dish and pour over sauce made of
one tablespoonful of butter rubbed into one and one half tablespoonfuls
of flour, pour over it one pint of hot milk, and cook until it is like
a custard. Sprinkle thick with bread crumbs and bake one half hour. Cut
the vegetables into small pieces before pouring over the sauce.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="ASPARAGUS">ASPARAGUS.</h2>
</div>

<h3>BAKED ASPARAGUS.</h3>

<p>Place the asparagus with the root ends together in a baking dish;
sprinkle in salt and black pepper; mix<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span> two tablespoonfuls of flour
smoothly with soft butter to make a thin paste; spread it over the
asparagus; cover the dish with a plate; lay a weight on it; cook it
until the asparagus is very tender. It may be served in the dish in
which it is baked.</p>


<h3>ASPARAGUS ON TOAST.</h3>

<p>Cut away the hard ends; wash, then tie lightly together in a large
bunch with the heads all one way; set in deep kettle with the heads
up, fill with salted water to within two inches of the top of the
asparagus; cover and let boil until the stems are tender; the steam
will have cooked the tops. Have ready bread toasted a delicate brown
in the oven. Cut toast in strips about two inches wide, lay it on hot
shallow dish or platter, butter liberally, drain the asparagus and pile
it on the toast; sprinkle liberally with butter, pepper, and salt, and
serve with cut lemon.</p>


<h3>ASPARAGUS WITH WHITE SAUCE.</h3>

<p>Make a good crust and line a baking dish, fill with cooked asparagus,
dress with the white sauce; cover with top crust; and bake in hot oven.</p>

Add three tablespoonfuls of flour<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span> mixed with one third teaspoonful of
baking powder, then a scant cupful of milk, and finally the boiled,
chopped tender tops of two bunches of asparagus. Put into a well
greased mould with a top, cook in a pot of boiling water two hours;
turn out and pour over it a cupful of drawn butter.</p>

</div>
<h3>CREAMED STRING BEANS.</h3>

<p>Cut the ends and string them. Put them in a covered saucepan with
water, and cook till tender, drain, and remove any strings that may
have adhered, then place again in the pan, add one cupful of cold milk,
and salt to taste; thicken with flour mixed smoothly with soft butter
to the consistency of thick cream; let them cook until the sauce is
thoroughly done, add a dash of pepper, and serve in hot covered dish.</p>


<h3>WAX BEANS.</h3>

<p>The yellow wax bean is very nice when young, prepare as you do any
string bean, stew until tender, letting liquor boil away and seasoning
with salt, pepper, and butter.</p>


<h3>BOSTON BAKED BEANS.</h3>

<p>Small navy beans are the best. Carefully pick over and wash one pint,
soak over night in enough water to cover; in the morning place in a
kettle with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span> fresh water and boil for fifteen minutes; skim out of
this water, and put into an earthen crock, add one large spoonful
of molasses; one teaspoonful of mustard, salt to taste, and a large
heaping tablespoonful of butter with water enough to cover; place a
cover on the crock and set in the oven, cook them all day. They need
to be watched at intervals of half an hour to see that the water
is visible at the top of the beans; the last hour, if the oven is
moderate, no more water should be added.</p>


<h3>DRIED LIMA BEANS.</h3>

<p>One cupful is sufficient for a family of five. Wash and put to soak
over night. Steam in double boiler, with just water enough to float,
until thoroughly tender. Salt to taste and add one tablespoonful of
butter and a dash of pepper.</p>

<p>Dried beans can be freshened in an hour by soaking in hot water, and
renewing the water as soon as it cools.</p>


<h3>FRESH LIMA BEANS.</h3>

<p>Boil until tender in just water enough to float, when nearly done,
uncover and let water simmer away, add one cupful of sweet cream, and
salt to taste just before serving. If you do not have cream, use milk,
thickened with one teaspoonful of flour mixed with one tablespoonful of
soft butter.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CORN">CORN.</h2>
</div>

<h3>ROASTED CORN.</h3>

on a gridiron over a clean coal fire, and turn them until they are well
toasted.</p>


<h3>CUT CORN.</h3>

<p>Steam the ears until tender, then strip them and cut the corn from the

and mix in proportion of one cupful of grated corn to three well beaten
eggs; salt<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span> to taste and fry in hot butter by spoonfuls; serve hot.
They are much more delicate and delicious than where flour and milk are
used. The corn supplies both the milk and flour in its own substance.
Grated, or very tender, canned corn can be used in the same way in the
winter season.</p>


<h3>BAKED CORN.</h3>

<p>Chop as fine as possible the contents of one can of corn; add a heaping
tablespoonful of butter; season to taste; add one pint of milk; put in
baking dish; place in oven and bake until a nice brown.</p>


<h3>CORN PUDDING.</h3>

<p>Cut enough uncooked corn from the cob to fill a pint measure; place in
covered sauce pan with a pint of cold milk; let cook until tender; then
add two tablespoonfuls of flour smoothly mixed with cold milk. Stir
until the mixture thickens; add two tablespoonfuls of butter; set it
off to cool.</p>

<p>Beat the yolks of four eggs in a large bowl; beat whites separately to
a stiff froth; then mix well with the yolks, add to the warm corn and
milk mixture, put into a hot buttered baking dish and brown in quick
oven.</p>


<h3>CORN ON TOAST.</h3>

<p>Take pieces of bread four inches square and fry a delicate brown in
butter; then heap on the bread a large tablespoonful of stewed or
canned corn and heat through thoroughly; serve very hot.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span></p>


<h3>CORN PATÊS.</h3>

<p>Chop finely half a can of corn; stir in bread crumbs until stiff;
season with salt and pepper; fill patê shells two thirds full and lay
piece of butter size of hickory nut on top of each filling; then pour
over each one a tablespoonful of cream; place in oven and bake till
delicate brown; serve hot. Very much like oysters.</p>

<p>If creamy dressing is preferred, omit the bread crumbs, and thicken the
cream with a little flour and butter before pouring over the corn, use
a little more cream to each shell.</p>

<p>Wash in cold water, and pick over very carefully. Put whole in a
covered boiler, with the stem end down, sprinkle well with salt, pour
over it a cupful of cold water, boil until it is very tender, then
uncover it for the water to boil away; set it on the back of range to
dry, take off the coarse outer leaves, serve it in a hot, deep, dish.
Cut the cabbage into halves or quarters and lay butter on each piece.</p>

<p>Cut a head of white cabbage in pieces two or three inches large, put
them into a covered saucepan with salt, one cupful of cold water, and
flour mixed to a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span> smooth thin paste with soft butter; boil until the
cabbage is very tender.</p>


<h3>CABBAGE IN MILK.</h3>

<p>Chop coarsely one-fourth large or one-half small head of cabbage; put
over in saucepan with enough salted water to float; let cook until
nearly done, then drain; add one quart of rich milk and cook until

<h3>GREEN PEAS.</h3>

<p>Do not wash peas, as it spoils their flavor and makes them less
nutritious. Peas should not be shelled until immediately before using.</p>


<h3>TO BOIL PEAS.</h3>

<p>Put them into a covered saucepan, with cold water enough to float them;
boil them until the peas are tender; then uncover them for the water to
boil away; set them at the back of range to dry; serve them in a hot,

<h3>BOILED POTATOES.</h3>

<p>Boiled potatoes are more nutritious when boiled in the skin. They
should be placed in a kettle with a sufficient amount of cold water to
cover them, salted to taste, cooked in an uncovered kettle, and the
water permitted to boil away; then let kettle remain on the back of
range where they will keep hot, until the potatoes are dry and mealy.
Peel before serving.</p>


<h3>NEW POTATOES.</h3>

<p>Small new potatoes with white skins need not be peeled, but should be
buttered liberally and served in a hot dish.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span></p>


<h3>MASHED POTATOES.</h3>

<p>Boil until tender and place in colander, have ready a large bowl with
tablespoonful of butter and half a cupful of cream; mash through the
colander into a bowl, then whip potatoes and seasoning thoroughly
with a fork, as a spoon destroys the delicacy; place in dish and set
uncovered over steam to heat thoroughly. Serve quickly.</p>


<h3>POTATO CROQUETTES.</h3>

<p>To one pint of hot mashed potatoes add one tablespoonful of butter, one
half saltspoonful of pepper, one half teaspoonful of salt, one dash of
cayenne, one half teaspoonful celery salt, and a few drops of onion
juice. Beat until very light. When slightly cooled, mix in yolk of one
egg; add one teaspoonful of chopped parsley. Shape into croquettes,
roll in fine bread crumbs, then in a mixture of egg and milk, roll
again in bread crumbs, let stand about fifteen minutes in a cold place,
then fry by plunging in very hot fat for a moment. Do not fry more than
three at a time, in order not to chill the fat. Drain carefully.</p>


<h3>POTATO PATÊS.</h3>

<p>Take a tablespoonful of warm mashed potato in the palm of your hand,
shaping it like a ball; then with a teaspoon take out a good part of
the center. Fill this potato patê shell with minced onion and celery
cooked tender in butter, and add a grating of cheese; season to taste,
then cover it over with potato;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span> dip into melted butter and egg; place
in a shallow baking pan and place in a hot oven, let come to a nice
brown; serve on platter garnished with parsley.</p>


<h3>SARATOGA CHIPS.</h3>

<p>Select medium sized potatoes, pare, wash, and slice them very thin; dry
with a napkin. Have kettle of cocoa butter, or oil, heated to right
temperature (see “Important Notes”) and sprinkle potatoes in kettle;
do not crowd; when a delicate brown, skim out, and place in sieve in a
warm place to drain; sprinkle lightly with salt.</p>


<h3>PRINCESS POTATOES.</h3>

<p>Boil and mash the desired quantity; while the potatoes are still warm
spread them half an inch thick on a plate and set away to cool. When
ready to use them, cut the potato into strips an inch wide and two
inches long; dip the strips into melted butter, and then into well
beaten egg, finally placing them in a baking pan and browning them in a
hot oven.</p>


<h3>WACHTMEISTER POTATOES.</h3>

<p>Select potatoes of medium size and perfect shape; scour the skins,
and steam until tender, then place in oven until skin is slightly
toughened; remove from oven and open at one end, carefully removing
contents, do not break the skins. Have ready a bowl of whipped cream;
mash the potatoes and mix freely with whipped cream. Stuff back in
potato skins and set in shallow dish, open ends up; place back in
oven<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span> and let them get thoroughly hot, then serve. One who has been
a strict vegetarian for years finds salt a poison; and it is omitted
intentionally in the “Wachtmeister” receipt. It can of course be added
to potato in mixing for those who desire it.</p>


<h3>POTATOES IN WHITE SAUCE.</h3>

<p>Peel and quarter potatoes, put them into saucepan (with salt, if
desired) add flour and butter, mixed to a smooth paste, in the
proportion of one tablespoonful of flour to two of soft butter, a
teaspoonful of chopped parsley and just water enough to float potatoes;
cover the saucepan and cook until potatoes are very tender.</p>


<h3>LYONAISE POTATOES.</h3>

<p>To one tablespoonful of finely chopped onion, add seasoning to taste;
place in frying pan with two tablespoonfuls of butter and let fry a
light brown, being careful not to burn. Have ready one quart of cold
boiled potato cut in small dice, add and turn delicately with fork
until potatoes have absorbed the butter; just before removing from fire
add one tablespoonful of chopped parsley. Serve very hot.</p>


<h3>ESCALOPED POTATOES.</h3>

<p>Pare, wash and slice enough potatoes to nearly fill a baking dish;
season to taste, fill the dish with cold milk and add one large
tablespoonful of butter distributed over the top, bake in moderate
oven, keeping dish covered until potatoes are nearly done. Then remove
cover and brown.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span></p>


<h3>FRENCH FRIED POTATOES.</h3>

<p>Peel and cut in strips medium or small potatoes, wash, then dry with a
clean towel. Have ready a kettle of cocoa butter thoroughly hot, drop
in potatoes and cook until a delicate brown; if salt is used sprinkle
slightly when taken from the fat, let drain in wire dish in the oven
one minute, then serve in hot dish.</p>


<h3>FRIED POTATOES.</h3>

<p>A nice way to fry potatoes is to dip them in egg and then in bread
crumbs; then fry until brown.</p>


<h3>POTATO SCONES.</h3>

<p>Boil potatoes in salted water; three good-sized potatoes making a
sufficient supply for moderate family; drain and mash; mix with just
enough flour to enable you to roll out the mixture, cut with biscuit
cutter and bake on an ungreased griddle, turning frequently. The scones
should have the thickness and consistency of wheat pancakes.</p>


<h3>POTATO PEARS.</h3>

<p>Cook five potatoes and rub through a strainer. While hot add two
tablespoonfuls of butter, one half teaspoonful of salt, one fourth
teaspoonful of celery salt, one fourth teaspoonful of pepper, a few
grains of cayenne, and one teaspoonful of chopped parsley. Beat
thoroughly and add yolk of one egg. Shape in the form of pears. Beat
one egg, slightly diluting with two tablespoonfuls of milk. Roll the
pears in the egg, then in crumbs, and fry in deep fat; dry on brown<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>
paper. Insert a clove at the blossom and stem of each pear. Garnish
with parsley.</p>


<h3>POTATO PANCAKES.</h3>

<p>Grate six large potatoes; drain, and add pint of cream or milk, two
well beaten eggs, one tablespoonful of flour, and beat well. Melt one
teaspoonful of butter in frying pan, pour in a thin layer of batter;
as it cooks loosen it from the pan, when a delicate brown, turn, and
brown. Serve hot.</p>

turn and brown on both sides. Serve on toast.</p>


<h3>FRICASSEED TOMATOES.</h3>

<p>Select large smooth tomatoes; cut them in half, do not peel. Take a
broad agate, or enameled pan and melt in it two ounces of butter; cover
the pan with the halved tomatoes that have been sprinkled with salt,
and pepper, and dipped in meal; whole wheat flour is best. Put cover
on pan and let cook until tomatoes are cooked through, but not broken.
The fire should be moderate, and it is well to lift the tomatoes
occasionally so they will not burn or stick to pan. When cooked, pour
in one half cupful sweet cream, let come to a scald, and serve.</p>

<h3>HOME MADE YEAST.</h3>

<p>Wash, pare, and soak one large potato. Steep one tablespoonful of hops
(loose) in one pint of boiling water; mix one heaping tablespoonful
of flour, one teaspoonful of sugar, one teaspoonful of salt, one
teaspoonful of ginger; grate the potato into the flour mixture; let
the hot water boil briskly for one minute, strain it over the flour
and potato mixture, and mix thoroughly; if it does not thicken like
starch, place it over the fire for a few minutes, stirring briskly. If
too thick, add boiling water till thin as cream. When lukewarm or at 70
degrees, add one half cake of yeast. Raise in a warm place till frothy,
beat it down every half hour. Bottle and keep in a cool place.</p>


<h3>THREE HOUR BREAD.</h3>

<p>Pour one cupful of boiling water over two tablespoonfuls of flour and
beat well; when this becomes lukewarm add two teaspoonfuls of sugar and
one yeast cake that has been dissolved in one half cupful of lukewarm
water. Beat thoroughly, add flour enough to make a thick batter, beat
until light and set in a warm place, about 90 degrees F. Keep covered
and let rise until light and frothy, with this proportion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span> of yeast it
should rise in thirty minutes. When light add one cupful of scalded
milk, cooled to lukewarm, and flour enough to make a stiff dough; stir
in the flour with a spoon, beating it thoroughly; when the dough begins
to stiffen, cut in the flour with a bread knife; add flour until the
dough slips easily from the board, and does not stick to the hands.
Then knead the dough on a slightly floured board until smooth, elastic,
and full of air bubbles. Knead it firmly, but lightly, using only the
wrist movements, put back in bowl, cover, and let rise in warm place
until it doubles in bulk; shape into loaves, or biscuit; brush lightly
with melted butter, and place in warm buttered pan. Let rise, closely
covered, until loaves have doubled in bulk. Bake in an oven hot enough
to brown one teaspoonful of flour placed on a piece of paper, in five
minutes. If biscuits are to be baked, the oven should be hot enough to
brown flour in two minutes. Let the bread bake from forty-five minutes
to one hour. The first quarter of the time the bread should rise, but
not form a crust; the second quarter the crust should form; the third
the crust should become golden brown; the fourth should complete the
baking. Place the loaf to cool uncovered, and in such a position that
the air can circulate freely around it, bottom and all.</p>


<h3>WHOLE WHEAT BREAD.</h3>

<p>Make a sponge of one half cupful lukewarm water, one half yeast cake
dissolved in one fourth cupful lukewarm<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span> water, and one cupful of white
flour; cover; and set in warm place,—about 90 degrees F.—until light
and foamy; add one half cupful scalded milk, cooled to lukewarm, one
half teaspoonful of salt and whole wheat flour to make a stiff dough;
knead thoroughly, put into warm place, let rise until it doubles
in bulk; mould into a loaf, put into a warm buttered pan, and keep
closely covered in warm place until it rises sufficiently to double
in size; put into a hot oven; at the end of fifteen minutes lower the
temperature of oven and bake at least forty-five minutes longer. This
makes one loaf.</p>


<h3>ENGLISH UNFERMENTED GRIDDLE BREAD.</h3>

<p>This bread is usually made from whole wheat flour. It is cooked on a
griddle, hence its name “Griddle Bread.” The griddle should be made
thoroughly hot before placing the dough on it, and sprinkled with a
little fine white flour. Measure the meal, and for every two level
measures of meal allow one measure of boiling water; have the meal in
a mixing bowl, and use a wooden spoon for stirring. Make a hole in
the center of the meal and pour the boiling water into it, stirring
all the time till it forms a mass or lump. No kneading is required.
Sprinkle the paste-board with fine white flour and turn the mass onto
it. Roll out into cakes, making the cake about half an inch thick. The
edge should not be ragged, but dredged with fine flour and pressed
with the knuckles to an even thickness. Dredge fine flour on each
piece, rub it well in with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span> fingers, then turn it on the other side
with the knife and do the same, so that the surface has a fine smooth
appearance. As each piece is prepared, place it on the hot griddle
plate. Two or three minutes is sufficient time to prepare the bread
from the moment the water boils. The time for the cooking necessarily
varies according to the heat of the fire, which should be kept at an
even temperature; twenty to thirty minutes will be found the average.</p>


<h3>TEA ROLLS.</h3>

<p>Make a sponge of one cupful of lukewarm water, one cake of yeast,
one fourth cupful sugar, and flour enough to make a soft dough. When
sufficiently raised add a little over a cupful of softened butter, and
three fourths of a cupful of luke warm milk and enough flour to keep
it a sponge. Beat well and let rise; then add beaten white of one egg
and enough flour to knead. Knead thoroughly and let it rise again; work
down; place in a buttered bowl; let it rise again, turn onto a board,
roll, and cut. Shape to suit fancy, in finger rolls, bread sticks, or
cleft rolls; place in pans and let rise; bake in hot oven. For Cinnamon
Rolls, make as above only roll out one fourth inch in thickness and
spread with softened butter, sugar, cinnamon, and currants. All bread
stuffs brown better if brushed over with melted butter.</p>


<h3>WHOLE WHEAT MUFFINS.</h3>

<p>Take one and one half cupfuls of whole wheat flour, one cupful of
common flour, two teaspoonfuls of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span> baking powder, mix, and sift
together; beat up one egg and add one cupful of milk; add one
tablespoonful of melted butter and stir into the dry mixture; bake in
gem pans in a hot oven for about twenty minutes.</p>


<h3>CORN MUFFINS.</h3>

<p>Mix thoroughly one cupful of white flour, one half cupful of fine
yellow corn meal, one eighth cupful of sugar, two tablespoonfuls of
baking powder; then beat one egg and stir in one cupful of sweet milk;
stir into dry mixture; then add one tablespoonful of melted butter;
beat well, and bake in muffin tins.</p>

<p>To one pint of sifted flour add two teaspoonfuls of baking powder; sift
together twice; then rub in one tablespoonful of shortening until fine,
like meal. Mix in gradually enough milk to make a soft dough, cutting
it in with bread knife; when stiff enough to be handled it should look
spongy in the cuts, and seem full of air; turn it out on a well floured
board, toss<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span> with knife until well floured, pat with rolling pin, and

<h3>WHOLE WHEAT.</h3>

<p>Sift one cupful of whole wheat meal into one pint of boiling water; add
salt to taste. Cook in double boiler and steam from one to two hours,
until meal is thoroughly cooked. Very nice when cold fried in delicate
slices and served with maple syrup.</p>

<p>Graham, rye, oat meal, or corn meal can be cooked in same way, only
they require longer cooking. Corn requires the most time. Corn and oat
meals need a larger quantity of water.</p>

<h3>CAKES.</h3>

<p>Thin cakes require a hotter oven than those baked in thick loaves.
Cakes with molasses in them burn more quickly than others. Thin cakes
should bake from fifteen to twenty minutes, thicker cakes from thirty
to forty minutes, and very thick loaves about one hour. If only the
yolks of the eggs are used the cake is richer, if only the whites it
is lighter. Have all ingredients ready, then see that fire and oven
are right, and mix carefully. The secret of fine grained cake is in
the mixing. First always cream the butter by beating, then add sugar
slowly, creaming carefully, then add the well beaten yolks of eggs.
Sift the flour and baking powder together three times, at least, then
add alternately in small quantities the flour and milk, and last of
all the stiffly beaten whites of eggs, working them in as lightly as
possible.</p>


<h3>ONE EGG CAKE.</h3>

<p>Cream one half cupful of butter in a warm bowl adding slowly one cupful
of sugar, whip the yolk of one egg and add to butter and sugar. Have
ready two cupfuls of flour into which has been sifted two teaspoonfuls
of baking powder; put flour and baking powder through sifter three
times. Add flour and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span> one cupful of milk slowly and alternately to
butter mixture, adding last of all the whites of egg beaten stiff and
one teaspoonful of flavoring. Bake in loaf in moderate oven for thirty
minutes.</p>


<h3>ORANGE CAKE.</h3>

<p>Cream one third cupful of butter with one and one half cupfuls of
sugar; add the well beaten yolks of three eggs and one teaspoonful of
flavoring, beat well; add alternately, in small quantities, two heaping
cupfuls of flour, into which two rounded teaspoonfuls of baking powder
has been sifted, and one cupful of milk; last of all add the whites of
the three eggs, beaten to a stiff froth, folding them into the dough
lightly. Bake in shallow pans for about twenty minutes, or until cake
shrinks from the pan. Put together with orange icing.</p>


<h3>IDA’S CAKE.</h3>

<p>Beat the whites of four eggs very stiff and set in refrigerator to
chill; cream the yolks; add one cupful of sugar and a teaspoonful of

slowly, stirring lightly; then fold in the whites of the eggs as
delicately as possible. Bake in moderate oven.</p>


<h3>ANGEL FOOD.</h3>

<p>Sift one cupful of flour and one half teaspoonful of cream of tartar

cold water, then two thirds of a cupful of flour into which one half
even teaspoonful of baking powder has been sifted, and lastly the
whites of the egg beaten stiff. Bake in shallow pan or in small tins.</p>


<h3>TEA CAKES.</h3>

<p>Tea cakes that are much esteemed in southern households are made from
the yolks of six eggs, half a pound of butter, one pound of sugar, one
pound of flour and one teaspoonful of baking powder mixed with the
flour. They should be rolled thin and baked in a quick oven. Frost with
a thin icing or sprinkle while hot with granulated sugar.</p>


<h3>POOR MAN’S CAKE.</h3>

<p>Take three good-sized apples, pare, chop them fine, put them into a
saucepan with two cupfuls of molasses, and boil until the apples are
soft—say for three minutes—remove, and add one cupful of sugar, one
egg, and one half teaspoonful of ginger, cinnamon allspice, clove
and nutmeg, one cupful of strong coffee in which one and one half
teaspoonfuls of soda are dissolved; two and one half cupfuls of flour.</p>

<h3>FRIED CAKES.</h3>

<p>Two cupfuls of sugar, four eggs, one cupful of sour cream, and one
cupful of buttermilk, one teaspoonful of soda, nutmeg to taste, flour
enough to make a soft dough; roll until one half inch thick, cut in
rounds, cutting out small ring in center; fry in hot cocoanut butter.
The fat should be deep enough to float the cakes and hot enough to cook
quickly; when nicely browned, drain, then powder with confectioner’s
sugar.</p>


<h3>SUGAR COOKIES.</h3>

<p>Mix one half cupful of creamed butter with one cupful of sugar, beat
to a smooth cream. Whip one egg<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span> light and add to sugar and butter;
add one teaspoonful of flavoring and one fourth cupful of milk with
flour enough to make sufficiently stiff to roll thin, having previously
sifted through the flour one half teaspoonful of baking powder. Roll a
little at a time, cut out and bake about ten minutes in hot oven.</p>


<h3>JUMBLES.</h3>

<p>Two eggs, six tablespoonfuls of butter, six tablespoonfuls of sugar,
one teaspoonful of lemon extract, a pinch of soda sifted in flour
enough to make a dough stiff enough to roll. Roll very thin, cut and
bake in quick oven.</p>


<h3>GINGER SNAPS.</h3>

and mix together lightly; then stir in very lightly one half pound of
flour. Transfer the mixture into fingers on sheets of paper. Dust with
powdered sugar, and put on pans and bake in hot oven. Watch them very
carefully, as it only takes a few minutes to bake them. When cold they
may be removed from the paper by placing them on the table face down,
and washing the bottom of the paper with a wet sponge. Now turn back
to their proper position and they can be easily removed. Join them in
pairs and keep them covered until used.</p>


<h3>ÊCLAIRS.</h3>

<p>Put into an enameled saucepan one quarter pound of butter, one quarter
pint of water, and a few drops of lemon juice; bring all to a boil;

<h3>PASTRY.</h3>

<p>Sift one cupful of flour and one saltspoonful of baking powder
together. Rub in two tablespoonfuls of shortening, mix quite stiff
with ice water, using about one fourth cupful. Turn out on a floured
board, pat, and roll till one fourth inch thick, then distribute one
teaspoonful of butter over the surface. Sprinkle with flour and fold
over and over, roll out again into a long strip, then roll like a jelly
roll, and cut from end as needed, and roll out from end. The secret of
good pastry is to thoroughly chill material.</p>

<p>For all fruit and custard pies brush bottom crust with white of egg
before putting in filling. The crust will then remain dry and delicate.</p>


<h3>A RICH PUFF PASTE.</h3>

<p>One quart of flour and one pound of butter; sift the flour and work in
the yolk of an egg well beaten; mix with ice water and roll out to the
thickness of an inch or less. After the butter has been worked in cold
water to extract the salt, place it on one half of the dough, folding
the other half over it, set away for fifteen minutes in an ice chest,
or other equally cold place, and then roll out into a long strip, which
fold<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span> into three parts by turning over each end and rolling each fold;
repeat this operation six or seven times. The colder the dough can be
kept while being worked in this way, the better will be the results.</p>


<h3>MINCE PIES.</h3>

<p>To one cupful of water add one cupful of molasses, one cupful of
sugar, one beaten egg, one cupful of vinegar, two and one half Boston
crackers, rolled fine, one cupful of stoned raisins, butter the size
of an egg, one quarter of a teaspoonful of cloves; two thirds of a
teaspoonful of cinnamon; two thirds of a teaspoonful of allspice.</p>

<p>This will make three pies. The pies should bake slowly, taking about
three quarters of an hour. A grating of nutmeg should be added to each
pie before putting on upper crust. The egg, cracker, and slow baking
thickens this apparently thin mixture.</p>


<h3>FRUIT PIE.</h3>

<p>Carefully wash two thirds of a cupful of dried currants, add equal
quantity of seeded raisins; with one cupful of sugar and one cupful of
water; place in saucepan and boil gently for one half hour; remove from
the fire and add two tablespoonfuls of vinegar, with cinnamon, cloves,
allspice, and nutmeg to taste; two chopped apples, one tablespoonful of
rolled crackers, half a cupful of chopped, sweet pickled peaches, or
any preserved or spiced fruit; bake with two crusts. This will make two
pies.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span></p>


<h3>CREAM PIE.</h3>

<p>Make a boiled custard, with one pint of milk, yolks of two eggs well
beaten, and three tablespoonfuls of sugar, place in double boiler and
thicken with one tablespoonful of flour that has been blended with
melted butter, add one half teaspoonful of vanilla, let cook until
flour is thoroughly done (if too thick a little more milk can be
added). Have ready a baked pastry, fill with the mixture; then whip
the whites of the two eggs to a very stiff froth and add one half
cupful sugar and a few drops of flavoring, spread over the pie; set in
oven just long enough to set the frosting and touch it with delicate
brown. Serve cold. A chocolate pie can be made after the same method
by omitting the yolks of the eggs and beating into hot milk one-fourth
cake of chocolate.</p>


<h3>CUSTARD PIE.</h3>

<p>Beat three eggs until light, add three tablespoonfuls of sugar and beat
again. Then grate sufficient nutmeg to flavor, and add three cupfuls of
scalded milk. Bake slowly in single crust; as soon as the custard puffs
and a knife blade can be dipped in and comes out clean, it is done.</p>


<h3>LEMON PIE.</h3>

<p>Beat the yolks of three eggs until thick, add one cupful of sugar and
the grated yellow rind of one large lemon (be very careful not to
grate any of the white of the lemon skin or it will make pie bitter),
also the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span> juice; beat until thick and light colored, then add one
tablespoonful of corn starch, dissolved in a little water. Pour into a
pie shell and bake slowly until it puffs. Beat the whites of the eggs
until light, then gradually add three tablespoonfuls of sugar and beat
until stiff. When the pie is slightly cooled, cover with this frosting,
return to oven, and let it get a very delicate brown. Serve cold.</p>


<h3>SQUASH PIE.</h3>

<p>To one and one half cupfuls of prepared squash, add one cupful of
scalded milk, one half cupful of sugar, one saltspoonful of cinnamon,
a dash of nutmeg and cloves, and one egg well beaten, pour in egged
crust, and bake thirty minutes, or until it puffs up all over. Sweet
potato may be used in place of squash. To prepare squash or sweet
potato, steam and mash.</p>


<h3>RIPE CURRANT PIE.</h3>

<p>To one cupful of the fruit, washed and removed from stems, add one
cupful of sugar; one cupful of cream, and one tablespoonful of flour;
bake with only an under crust.</p>


<h3>NEUFCHATEL CHEESE PIE.</h3>

<p>One Neufchatel cheese, one teacupful of sugar, grate the rind of one
lemon and use with it one half of the juice, half a teacupful each

melted butter, half a teacupful of cream, or rich milk,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span> half a nutmeg
grated and one saltspoonful of salt. Crumble the cheese and cracker
crumbs well together, beat the eggs with the sugar and add to cracker
mixture, following with the butter and cream. If the cream is very rich
the butter may be omitted. Lastly, add lemon, nutmeg and currants. The
currants should previously be washed, dried and dusted with flour. Mix
all well together and put into well buttered patty-pans that have been
lined with puff-paste. Bake fifteen or twenty minutes in a quick oven.
They will puff up, but must not be permitted to get too brown.</p>


<h3>PINE-APPLE TART.</h3>

<p>Line a pie plate with pastry, and fill with mixture made of one ounce
of butter, and one half cupful of sugar beaten to a cream; the well
beaten yolks of five eggs, a grated pineapple, one teacupful of cream
and add last of all the whites of the eggs beaten stiff and folded in
lightly, with a little more sugar.</p>


<h3>ALMOND PEACH PIE.</h3>

<p>Line a pie dish with puff or good plain paste, lay halves of canned
peaches, with the stone side up all over the bottom of the crust;
fill the cavity where the pit was with a spoonful of chopped almonds;
sprinkle with sugar and pour over a very little of the peach juice;
cover with a crust, and bake till a nice brown; serve with, or without
cream.</p>

mould. Set away to harden; serve plain, or with cream. Orange may be
used in place of lemon, though a dessert spoonful of lemon juice used
with the orange improves the flavor. This Irish Moss may be substituted
in place of gelatine in all delicate puddings calling for that animal
product; it is to be had at any druggist’s.</p>

the juice of one lemon, the grated yellow rind of two oranges, and
three cupfuls of sugar. Whip till very light the yolks of twelve eggs;
then whip in the prepared juice. Whip the whites of eggs as stiff as
possible (keep them well chilled while whipping) and beat in lightly,
yet thoroughly, the prepared mixture. Serve in punch glasses with lady
fingers. Place half of a lady finger in bottom of each glass. The
amount of sugar used may vary according to the flavor of the oranges.
If the foam is not stiff, then add more whites of eggs. It is difficult
to give exact quantities because the flavor and juiciness of the fruit
varies so. This should be prepared just before serving.</p>

liberally, and apply filling between layers and on top; serve with
whipped cream. Canned pineapple may be used, though the fresh fruit is
best.</p>


<h3>BANANA FILLING.</h3>

<p>Slice three bananas and one orange, grate the outside rind of the
orange and mix with one cupful of sugar, and juice of orange; pour on
the sliced bananas. Butter the short-cake and fill with the fruit thus
prepared. Serve plain, or with whipped cream.</p>

<h3>WATER ICES.</h3>

<p>The simplest way of making fruit ices is much the best. Take one pint
of water to one quart of fruit juice, sweetened to taste; and it should
be remembered the sugar is less apparent in the frozen mixture than
in the liquid. This proportion holds for all fruit ices; except the
lemon. The lemon prepare as you would a rich lemonade, adding the well
beaten whites of two eggs to each quart of the mixture. Be careful to
freeze smoothly and the ices will be delicious. I especially recommend
strawberry, pineapple, apricot, orange and lemon.</p>


<h3>UNCOOKED CREAM.</h3>

<p>To one quart of cream, add one teaspoonful of vanilla flavoring, and
one cupful of sugar. If you have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span> a freezer that stirs with the triple
movement in freezing, it is unnecessary to whip the cream. Otherwise it
should be partially whipped before being placed in freezer.</p>


<h3>FRENCH CREAM.</h3>

<p>Scald one pint of milk in double boiler; beat two eggs with one cupful
of sugar until light; then whip in two tablespoonfuls of flour; turn
into hot milk and stir until it thickens, cook fifteen minutes and set
away to cool. When cold add one quart of whipped cream, and one cupful
more of sugar with one tablespoonful of vanilla flavoring; freeze.</p>


<h3>CHOCOLATE CREAM.</h3>

<p>To make chocolate cream add to the above, when the custard is being
prepared, one ounce of dissolved sweet chocolate that has been
cooked to a gloss with one tablespoonful of boiling water and two
tablespoonfuls of sugar. Omit the second cupful of sugar usually added
with cream.</p>


<h3>WACHTMEISTER PUDDING.</h3>

<p>Fill a mould with alternate layers of sponge cake and jam,—strawberry
or apricot, are preferable,—then saturate with rich cream flavored
with vanilla and sweetened. Freeze in moulds. Custard may be used in
place of cream.</p>


<h3>FROZEN FRUITS.</h3>

<p>To one pound of mashed fruit, add whites of three eggs, and one pint
each of sugar and water. Make a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span> syrup of the sugar and water; when
cool, add the fruit and freeze.</p>

<p>With sweet fruits like oranges or raspberries, add juice of one lemon
and one half cupful more of sugar. The fruit is very nice, without the
addition of the eggs.</p>


<h3>PINEAPPLE SHERBET.</h3>

<p>To one quart of grated pineapple pulp, add juice of two lemons;
dissolve one and one half pounds of sugar in one pint of water, and
bring to a boil, skim and cool; when cold, add the fruit pulp, and the
well whipped whites of two eggs; freeze soft.</p>


<h3>STRAWBERRY SHERBET.</h3>

<p>Crush a pound of picked strawberries in a basin and add a quart of
water with a sliced lemon, let stand for three hours; put one and one
quarter pounds of sugar into another basin, cover the basin with a
cheese cloth and pour the berry juice through it. When the sugar is
fully dissolved strain again. Freeze soft.</p>

<h3>CANDY DOUGH.</h3>

<p>To the white of one egg placed in a glass add equal quantity of cold
water, or better yet, rich, sweet cream, and one teaspoonful of vanilla
extract. Beat thoroughly; then stir in gradually enough confectioner’s
XXXX sugar to make stiff. Cover with damp napkin and use as needed for
the following varieties:</p>


<h3>CHOCOLATE CREAMS.</h3>

<p>Mould small pieces of candy dough into the shape of thimbles, put them
on a buttered pan or paraffine paper in a cool place to harden. Melt
two squares of sweet chocolate in a saucer over a tea kettle. When the
cream balls are sufficiently hard, dip them in the melted chocolate.
Use two forks. Let the candies drain on the forks, then put them on the
tins again to dry.</p>


<h3>CREAM WALNUTS.</h3>

<p>Break pieces of candy dough to the size of a nutmeg, roll them in the
palm of the hand until smooth and round. Press halved walnut meats on
each side, letting cream show between.</p>


<h3>CREAM ALMONDS.</h3>

<p>Mould almond nut into center of a small ball of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span> candy dough. Roll in

<p>Wash and dry dates, remove the stones, and fill with candy dough, then
roll in confectioner’s sugar.</p>


<h3>ORANGE CREAMS.</h3>

<p>Take the white of one egg and an equal quantity of orange juice, and
grated yellow rind of one orange, mix with confectioner’s sugar until a
stiff dough. Mould in shapely lumps and roll in granulated sugar. This
also serves for orange flavored filling for chocolate drops. Any fruit
juice can be used in this same way. Any flavor desired that cannot be
obtained readily from fresh fruit can be had by using extract with
white of egg and cream base.</p>


<h3>CHOCOLATE ANNAS.</h3>

<p>To three cupfuls of white sugar, add one cupful of milk and one fourth
teaspoonful of cream of tartar, boil about nine minutes, or until
it will form a soft ball when dropped into cold water; then add two
squares of melted chocolate and one tablespoonful of butter. Cook one
minute longer. Remove from fire, add one teaspoonful vanilla extract,
beat vigorously<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span> for one minute, then pour into buttered pans. When
cool mark in squares.</p>


<h3>MOLASSES CANDY.</h3>

<p>Two cupfuls of molasses, one cupful of sugar, one teaspoonful of
vinegar, one tablespoonful of butter. Boil until it is brittle when
tried in cold water. Pour in a buttered tin; when cool pull until white.</p>


<h3>BROWN BETTIES.</h3>

<p>Two cupfuls of brown sugar, half a cupful of milk, boil about four
minutes, stirring constantly; when almost done stir in three quarters
of a cupful of chopped walnuts or chopped blanched almonds; remove from
the fire and stir till it grains, and looks sugary, then pour into a
well oiled tin to the depth of half an inch; when it cools mark off in
squares with a knife.</p>


<h3>LEMON MINTS.</h3>

<p>Sift a quantity of confectioner’s sugar into a bowl and work into it
lemon juice until all sugar is absorbed, then add water, a very little
at a time, until a smooth, stiff paste is formed. A bit of the lemon
peel may be grated into it. Roll into balls and flatten, placing them
in the oven a moment to harden.</p>


<h3>SOFT CARAMELS.</h3>

<p>One quart of brown sugar, half a pint of milk, one third cupful of
butter, and half a cake of chocolate. Boil about nine minutes, but not
so long that you cannot pour them into the pan. Mark into squares.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span></p>


<h3>BUTTER SCOTCH.</h3>

<p>Two cupfuls of light brown sugar, one cupful of butter, one
tablespoonful of lemon juice and one of water. Mix all together and
boil twenty minutes, add one fourth teaspoonful of baking soda, drop
a little in water and if it is crisp it is ready to take off. If not,
cook longer; when done, pour into a flat buttered tin.</p>


<h3>MARSHMALLOWS.</h3>

<p>Three ounces of gum-arabic, half a pint of hot water, half a pint
of powdered sugar, the white of one egg, flavoring. Dissolve the
gum-arabic in the water, strain, and add the sugar. Boil ten minutes or
until the syrup has the consistency of honey, stirring all the time.
Add the egg, beaten stiff, and as soon as thoroughly mixed remove from
the fire; add flavoring to taste, orange flower or rose is generally
used. Pour the paste into a pan dusted with corn starch. The paste
should be spread one inch thick. Cut into squares when cold, and roll
in powdered sugar.</p>


<h3>CHOC-O-POP.</h3>

<p>Have ready a mixture made of one cupful of sugar, one half cupful of
molasses and one cake of chocolate, cooked until it nearly crisps in
cold water, keep warm. Pop corn enough to fill a three quart bowl, turn
into a big pan and mix with the candy.</p>


<h3>CRACKER-JACK.</h3>

<p>Is made in the same way, only use one third sugar to two thirds
molasses and omit the chocolate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span></p>


<h3>FROSTED FRUITS.</h3>

<p>Carefully pick over and wash the fruit, such as cherries, plums or
strawberries. Whip the whites of two or three eggs, according to
quantity of fruit; dip the fruit in beaten egg, drain (keep the eggs
well beaten) then dip fruit into powdered sugar. Cover a pan with a
sheet of white paper, place the fruit on glass dish; dry, chill, and
serve.</p>


<h3>STUFFED DATES.</h3>

<p>Wash and carefully dry the dates by placing them in a colander and
letting stand in warm place; remove the stones and insert half a pecan,
or one fourth of an English walnut; roll in confectioner’s sugar.</p>


<h3>SALTED ALMONDS.</h3>

<p>Blanch half a pound of almonds by pouring over them one pint boiling
water; let stand three minutes. Drain and cover with cold water. Remove
the skins and dry the almonds on a towel. Fry in hot butter. Drain on
brown paper, and sprinkle with salt.</p>


<h3>BUTTER SCOTCH.</h3>

<p>One cupful of sugar, one cupful of molasses, half a cupful of butter,
nearly one tablespoonful of vinegar, a pinch of soda; boil until done;
when cold, cut into squares and wrap in paraffine paper.</p>


<h3>CARAMELS.</h3>

<p>One cupful of molasses, one half cupful of milk, one cupful of sugar,
one teaspoonful of flour, one tablespoonful of butter, one fourth pound
of chocolate; boil<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span> until it will harden when dropped in cold water,
then add a few drops of glycerine and one teaspoonful of vanilla; turn
into a buttered pan, when partly cool, mark in squares.</p>


<h3>COFFEE CREAM CARAMELS.</h3>

<p>Melt two pounds of sugar with as little water as possible; when the
sugar begins to bubble, pour in slowly one teacupful of rich cream and
stir carefully; add two ounces of fresh butter and the extract from two
ounces of coffee, stirring gently and continuously while adding. As
soon as cooked sufficiently to be brittle when dropped in cold water,
pour into buttered tin dish, and when nearly cooled, mark off with a
buttered knife into squares.</p>


<h3>CHOCOLATE CARAMELS.</h3>

<p>Cream together one teacupful of sugar with half the quantity of butter;
add one fourth of a pound of grated chocolate and one teacupful each of
molasses and milk. Beat well together and boil until a portion of it
dropped in ice-water sets and cracks. Pour into well buttered tin pans
to the thickness of half an inch. When nearly cold mark into squares
with a buttered knife.</p>


<h3>LEMON CANDY.</h3>

<p>Put one pound of sugar into a pan or kettle with half a pint of water
and a third of a teaspoonful of cream of tartar; let it boil, and when
a little of it dropped in cold water becomes brittle it is done; pour<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span>
into a shallow buttered dish. When cooled sufficiently to be handled
add one third of a teaspoonful of tartaric acid with the same quantity
of extract of lemon, and work thoroughly into the candy until the acid
has been evenly distributed. If worked too much the transparency of the
candy may be destroyed.</p>


<h3>COCOANUT DROPS.</h3>

<p>Grate one cocoanut and add to it one half its weight in sugar and the
white of an egg whipped to a stiff froth. Mix all together thoroughly
and drop on buttered white paper in a pan. Bake for fifteen minutes.</p>


<h3>KISSES.</h3>

<p>Beat the whites of four eggs to a stiff froth and stir in half a pound
of confectioner’s sugar, flavor with one half teaspoonful of vanilla.
Whip thoroughly and then drop in quantities about half the size of an
egg on buttered paper, well separated; lay the paper on a half inch
board and place in moderate oven. Watch carefully and when they begin
to color take them out, remove from paper and join them in pairs by
their flat surfaces.</p>

<h3>TEA.</h3>

<p>Tea should be made with the little filagree silver balls that come
especially for that purpose. Fill ball with best quality Oolong, or
English Breakfast, tea that you can obtain (cheap teas are injurious
and tasteless). Have a pot of boiling water, fill your cup and then
immerse the tea ball in cup until the strength desired is obtained.
Serve with sugar and sliced lemon, after the Russian fashion; it is
more wholesome than with cream.</p>


<h3>COCOA.</h3>

<p>Allow one teaspoonful of cocoa and sugar to one cupful of milk and
water, in equal proportions. Heat the milk in double boiler. Put the
water in the cocoa pot, when it boils stir in the dry cocoa, mix well.
After boiling three minutes, add the hot milk. Serve when it begins to
rise in the pot.</p>


<h3>FRENCH COFFEE.</h3>

<p>Three pints of water to one cupful of ground coffee. Put coffee in
bowl; pour over it about half pint cold water and let stand for fifteen
minutes; bring remaining water to a boil. Take coffee in bowl, strain
through fine sieve, then take French coffee pot, put coffee<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span> grounds in
strainer at top of French pot, leaving water in bowl. Then take boiling
water and pour over coffee very slowly. Then set coffee-pot on stove
for five minutes; do not let boil. Take off and pour in cold water from
bowl that coffee was first soaked in, to settle. Serve in another pot.
The French, who have the reputation of making the best coffee, use
three parts Java to one part of Mocha.</p>


<h3>AMERICAN COFFEE.</h3>

<p>Allow one tablespoonful of ground coffee to each cupful of water used;
mix coffee with half the white of one egg; add one cupful of cold water
and shake well, then add as many more cupfuls of cold water as you have
allowed for. Place on back of range and steep ten minutes, then bring
forward. Let come to a boil. Settle with one half cupful of cold water.</p>


<h3>CARAMEL COFFEE.</h3>

<p>To prepare, take three and one half quarts of bran, add one and one
half quarts of corn meal, one pint of molasses, one half pint of
boiling water, mix well, and bake, stirring often. Make the same as
“American Coffee,” only let boil a little longer.</p>


<h3>CHOCOLATE.</h3>

<p>Melt dry, over steam, one half cake of sweet chocolate; bring to a
scald one quart of rich milk, add one cupful of sugar, turn into a
heated bowl, then add the melted chocolate and whip with egg beater
until chocolate is thoroughly dissolved in the milk. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span> longer it is
whipped the better it will be. Serve with whipped cream.</p>


<h3>APRICOT WATER.</h3>

<p>Skin twelve apricots, take out the stones, pour on one quart of boiling
water; allow them to stew for one hour, then strain off the clear
liquid and sweeten with three ounces of sugar.</p>


<h3>GINGERADE.</h3>

<p>Gingerade is made of any fruit, stewed with pulverized ginger, flavored
with lemon juice, and carefully strained.</p>


<h3>GRAPE JUICE.</h3>

<p>Wash and remove from stems ten pounds of grapes, put over to boil with
two quarts of water. Let boil until seeds and pulp separate. Strain
through cheese cloth bag, let it drain slowly, do not squeeze. Put
juice back in kettle, let come to a boil, and add one and one fourth
pounds of sugar; boil two or three minutes. Seal boiling hot. The
secret of success in bottling grape juice is to have everything boiling
hot, jars, juice, rubbers, and tops. The best way is to have jars in
kettle of boiling water right on the stove and tops in boiling water,
likewise, and fill right from kettle of boiling juice on the stove.
Then if your cans are air-tight the juice will surely keep.</p>


<h3>FRUIT JUICES.</h3>

<p>The following rules hold good for any kind of fruit: Crush the small
fruits raw, strain, add one half pound<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span> of sugar to each quart of
juice, let boil one minute, and bottle, using same precautions as those
specified in receipt for grape juice.</p>


<h3>PINEAPPLE FRAPPÉ.</h3>

<p>Boil one quart of water, one pint of sugar, and one pint of chopped
pineapple for twenty minutes; add one cupful of orange juice and one
half cupful of lemon juice. Freeze soft.</p>


<h3>ORANGE FRAPPÉ.</h3>

<p>Make a syrup by boiling one quart of water and one pint of sugar for
twenty minutes; add one pint of orange juice and the juice of two
lemons; one cupful of candied cherries should be added just before
freezing. Freeze soft.</p>

<h3>RHUBARB MARMALADE.</h3>

<p>Peel and cut into inch pieces tender young rhubarb, to every pint allow
one pound of loaf sugar and three oranges. Spread the cut rhubarb on a
shallow dish and cover with the sugar; leave it for twelve hours; then
put it into the preserving kettle with the grated yellow rind of the
oranges (be careful not to use any of the white pulp or it will make
the preserve bitter), add the tender, juicy pulp of the oranges and
boil slowly for about one hour, or until jam sets when tested on a cold
plate.</p>


<h3>ORANGE MARMALADE.</h3>

<p>To every pound of sliced oranges (one half Seville and one half
sweet) add three pints of cold water; let stand in a cool place for
forty-eight hours; then boil all together until tender, generally about
two hours; set away for twenty-four hours. Then weigh the fruit and to
every pound of the boiled fruit add three fourths of a pound of sugar.
Boil until it will “set” when tried on a chilled plate.</p>


<h3>LEMON MARMALADE.</h3>

<p>Pour a scant quart of boiling water over two pounds of sugar and let
it stand until dissolved. Put<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span> in agate preserving kettle and peel
some very thin, thread-like strips of the delicate yellow rind of
the lemons; add to the liquid; carefully peel and remove all fibrous
parts from six large lemons, collect the seeds, tying them in a thin
cloth; add the pulp and the little bag of seeds to syrup, keep kettle
uncovered and let preserve boil gently. When it “sets” on a chilled
plate it is done. The seeds used in this way make it jell much more
quickly and the marmalade is more delicate in flavor.</p>


<h3>APRICOT MARMALADE.</h3>

<p>Choose deep yellow apricots, not too ripe; take off the skin, take out
the stones, and extract the kernel. To each twelve pounds of fruit
add eight pounds of sugar, put in agate kettle, and boil until it
will “set” by dropping into a chilled plate. It needs to be stirred
frequently and carefully watched to prevent burning.</p>

<h3>PEA SOUP.</h3>

<p>One pint of fresh, or one can of marrowfat peas; boil until thoroughly
soft so they will mash easily; then strain through a sieve to remove
skins. To pulp and liquor add one pint of cream, one teaspoonful of
sugar, salt and pepper to taste, and one tablespoonful of butter.
Serve with wafers. This is a very nutritious and relishable soup for a
convalescent.</p>


<h3>MILK TOAST.</h3>

<p>Brown delicately a thin slice of stale bread, cut in strips and
place in bowl; to one cupful of rich milk, brought to a scald, add a
teaspoonful of butter, have ready one heaping teaspoonful of flour
blended with water, strain into scalding milk and stir until it
thickens, set back and let cook gently while you whip the white of one
egg to a stiff froth, add a pinch of salt, then take the simmering milk
from the stove and whip the beaten white of egg in quickly. Pour over
toast in bowl and serve at once.</p>


<h3>CUP CUSTARD.</h3>

<p>Allow one egg and three fourths of a cupful of rich milk for each cup,
sweeten to taste and flavor with grated nutmeg, or vanilla extract,
as you prefer, pour<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span> in cups, set cup in shallow tin half filled with
water, and place in oven; bake until solid, and knife blade can be
drawn out clean. Cooking in the pan of water prevents custards from
separating and becoming watery.</p>


<h3>RICE FOAM.</h3>

<p>Wash one heaping teaspoonful of rice and cook until thoroughly tender
in milk; mash through a sieve; add pinch of salt; heat a half cupful of
cream to a scald, and stir in the rice. Whip the white of one egg to a
stiff froth, and add immediately on removing from the stove. A bit of
chopped parsley may be added, if liked. Serve with wafers. This is a
pleasant change from sweet gruels, and is very nutritious.</p>


<h3>CREAMED GRUEL.</h3>

<p>Cook one tablespoonful of rolled oats in scant pint of water; when soft
strain through a sieve; add one half cupful of cream; salt to taste,
and let come to a scald. Have ready the whites of two eggs beaten to
a stiff froth, take gruel from the fire and whip in the eggs, sweeten
to taste and flavor with a dash of nutmeg or a few drops of vanilla
extract.</p>


<h3>EGG GRUEL.</h3>

<p>Heat a cupful of milk to 180 F., and stir into it one well beaten egg
mixed with one fourth cupful of cold water. Stir constantly for a few
minutes until thickened, but do not allow it to boil again. Season with
salt, or if preferred, a little loaf sugar.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</span></p>


<h3>BARLEY GRUEL.</h3>

<p>Wash three tablespoonfuls of pearl barley, drop it into a pint of
boiling water and parboil five minutes. Pour the water off and add
one quart of fresh boiling water, let it simmer gently from one to
three hours, strain, season, and serve. A small piece of lemon rind
added to the gruel one half hour before it is done will give an
agreeable flavor. Equal quantities of barley gruel and milk make a very
nourishing drink; a little lemon juice with sugar to taste is sometimes
liked as the flavor for the gruel.</p>


<h3>ARROWROOT.</h3>

<p>Mix two tablespoonfuls of arrowroot with four tablespoonfuls of cold
water; add half a pint of boiling water and boil until it thickens;
sweeten to taste and add a little grated nutmeg.</p>

<p>Mix one tablespoonful of graham meal in four tablespoonfuls of cold
water, stir it into a pint of boiling water, cook twenty minutes, salt
to taste, and boil ten minutes longer, put a gill of thin gruel into a
cup with one half gill of milk or cream, and serve hot.</p>


<h3>EGG NOGG.</h3>

<p>Beat the yolk of a freshly laid egg with a tablespoonful of sugar until
it is light and creamy, add to this one half cupful of milk (hot or
cold, as you wish the drink, warm, or chilled), whip in, lightly, the
white of the egg, beaten stiff, a light grating of nutmeg, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span> if
mixed cold, a tablespoonful of cracked ice. Serve at once.</p>


<h3>EGG AND LIME WATER.</h3>

<p>To a wineglass full of lime water, add the stiffly beaten white of one
egg. Give this often, in small quantities, to patient. It is excellent
in cases of obstinate vomiting and bowel trouble.</p>


<h3>APPLE WATER.</h3>

<p>Wash and wipe a large sour apple and, without paring, cut it into thin
slices. Put them in a bowl with one strip of lemon peel, add one cupful
of boiling water, cover and set away to cool, strain when cold, sweeten
and serve with cracked ice. Cranberries or rhubarb may be used in the
same way.</p>


<h3>EGG LEMONADE.</h3>

<p>Beat the white of an egg to a stiff froth, mix with it the juice of a
small lemon and one tablespoonful of sugar. Add one cupful of ice water
and shake thoroughly.</p>


<h3>ARROWROOT WATER.</h3>

<p>Boil the thin rind of a fresh lemon in one quart of water. When
boiling, pour over one tablespoonful of arrowroot previously mixed with
a little cold water, stir well, sweeten to taste, and let it boil for
five minutes; squeeze in the juice of one lemon.</p>


<h3>BARLEY WATER.</h3>

water, sugar to taste. Wash the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</span> barley in cold water, add boiling
water, juice of lemon, a bit of rind, let stand, covered, and warm for
three hours.</p>


<h3>EGG TEA.</h3>

<p>Take the white of one egg and beat it to a stiff froth, beat the yolk
into it with a scant tablespoonful of sugar, then pour in slowly
(beating the mixture all the time) half a cupful of hot milk; flavor
with grated nutmeg or vanilla to taste.</p>


<h3>TOAST WATER.</h3>

<p>Brown nicely in the oven slices of bread, and pour upon them sufficient
boiling water to cover. Let them steep until cold, keeping the bowl or
dish containing the toast closely covered. Strain off the water and
sweeten to taste. Chill by setting dish in bowl of chopped ice.</p>


<h3>BARLEY WATER.</h3>

<p>Put two ounces of pearl barley into half a pint of boiling water and
let it simmer a few minutes. Drain off and add two quarts of boiling
water with a few figs and stoned raisins cut fine. Boil slowly until
reduced about one half and strain. Sweeten to taste, adding the juice
of a lemon and nutmeg if desired.</p>


<h3>BAKED MILK.</h3>

<p>Put the milk in a jar, covering the opening with white paper, and bake
in a moderate oven until thick as cream. May be taken by the most
delicate stomach.</p>

<h3>FLAXSEED LEMONADE.</h3>

<p>Pour on four tablespoonfuls of whole flaxseed one quart of boiling
water and add the juice of two lemons. Let it steep for three hours,
keeping it closely covered. Strain and sweeten to taste.</p>

<h3>THE WAY TO TEST HOT FAT.</h3>

<p>If a bit of dry bread will brown in one minute fat is hot enough for a
raw mixture. If cooked mixtures are to be browned the fat should be hot
enough to brown a piece of bread in forty seconds. This method however,
is only a makeshift and is not absolutely accurate. A thermometer
should be used; 380 to 390 degrees is the right temperature for frying
vegetable substances. Heat fat slowly.</p>


<h3>CELERY FLAVORING.</h3>

<p>Clean the green stalks and leaves of celery and dry, place in paper
bags to be used for soups and savories when celery is out of season.
This can be used in place of the celery seed called for in some
receipts.</p>


<h3>NUT BUTTER.</h3>

<p>Peanuts shelled and well roasted with the skins rubbed off will, when
ground, dissolve into a buttery substance which can be spread on bread
and made into sandwiches. All kinds of nuts reduced to flour can be
readily digested and can be placed on the table to be eaten with bread
or spread on sandwiches.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</span></p>


<h3>BAY LEAVES.</h3>

<p>Bay leaves contribute a most delicate and pungent flavor to soups,
savories and gravies. They can be obtained at any druggist’s, and five
cents worth will last a long time.</p>

<h3>SUET.</h3>

<p>In place of suet use bread crumbs soaked in oil or butter.</p>


<h3>MEATS.</h3>

<p>Use nuts as substitute for meats. To prepare the nuts for cooking, pick
from the shell carefully and chop very fine, or better yet, grind in
nut mill.</p>


<h3>GELATINE.</h3>

<p>In place of gelatine, use Irish Moss or corn starch.</p>


<h3>MEAT FATS.</h3>

<p>Nut butter takes the place of meat extract and fats in gravies and
sauces. Where plain butter is preferred with a savory flavoring of
herbs, always brown the flour used for thickening.</p>


<h3>PASTRY.</h3>

<p>Cocoanut or cow’s butter is the substitute for lard or cotoline in
vegetarian pastry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</span></p>


<h3>HERBS.</h3>

<p>The value of herbs for savories and soups is too little understood by
American cooks. Here is “Aunt Susan’s” receipt for a “soup powder” that
will flavor any soup, gravy, or savory dish with a fine flavor:</p>


<h3>SOUP POWDER.</h3>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Sweet Marjoram—Powdered, two ounces.</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Parsley—Powdered, two ounces.</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Summer Savory—Powdered, two ounces.</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Thyme—Powdered, two ounces.</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Bay Leaf—Powdered, two ounces.</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Lemon Peel—Powdered, one ounce.</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Sweet Basil—Powdered, one ounce.</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Rosemary—Powdered, one ounce.</span><br>
</p>


<h3>TO PREPARE ONIONS FOR SALADS OR FILLINGS.</h3>

<p>Peel and slice, or chop, cover the onions with boiling water, and let
stand three or four minutes, drain and put in ice water, let stand ten
or fifteen minutes, or, until crisp. The onions are just as crisp as
before, and much more delicate.</p>


<h3>THE WAY TO DRY CORN.</h3>

<p>Just scald, then cut from the cob, put in a pan and set over kettle
of boiling water; stir frequently, and in a couple of hours the corn
will be almost dry, if the water in kettle has been constantly kept at
boiling. Set in warm oven half an hour and the corn is ready to put in
bags; dry and clean.</p>

<h3>COLORING FOR SAUCES AND SOUPS.</h3>

<p>Crush a quarter of a pound of loaf sugar to powder, put it into a
sauce pan with a tablespoonful of water, and stir it unceasingly over
a gentle fire until it begins to acquire a little color. Draw it back
and bake it very slowly, still stirring it, until it is almost black,
without being in the least burnt. It will take about half an hour. Pour
a quart of water over it, let it boil for a few minutes until the sugar
is quite dissolved, pour it out, and when cold, strain it into a bottle
and store it for use. A tablespoonful of this browning will color half
a pint of liquid.</p>


<h3>BOILING VEGETABLES.</h3>

<p>It is very essential for health that all the properties of food should
be retained in the cooking, therefore<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</span> the habit of boiling the various
vegetables, in an unnecessary quantity of water, and then draining this
down the sink, is a means of defrauding the organism of the nourishment
originally contained in the article.</p>

<p>Potatoes, carrots, parsnips, and other articles requiring their skins
to be removed for serving or mincing, should, when possible, be steamed
“in their jackets” and peeled as much as necessary afterwards.</p>

<p>Cauliflowers, cabbage, &amp;c., are excellent when steamed. Green peas,
beans, and such, should be put in a covered vessel, with a little
butter, and, when necessary, a spoonful or two of water, and gently
stewed, standing inside a saucepan of water without the water touching
them; or they can be stewed in the oven in an earthenware jar, with a
little butter and a spoonful or two of water. This method of cooking
takes very little longer time than the ordinary boiling in water. The
oven should be moderately heated.</p>


<h3>STEWING FRUITS.</h3>

<p>Fruits are better stewed in a double enamelled saucepan, or baked in
a tightly covered earthen jar in the oven with as little water as
possible.</p>

<p>Dried fruits, such as raisins, figs, dates, &amp;c., should be washed and
picked over carefully, then soaked for several hours in cold water till
they are soft and swollen to their fullest extent, when they should be
stewed in the same water.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</span></p>


<h3>USE OF SALT.</h3>

<p>As little salt as is palatable should be used, and an effort made to
daily lessen its use. When once the system is freed from the use of
this mineral in its daily food, a small dose shows it to be an active
poison. There is enough of natural salts in our vegetable foods without
our making use of the mineral deposit. Knowing that many will use this
book who are just turning from the meat diet, we give, as a rule, the
usual quantity of salt in the receipts used in ordinary cookery. For
the same reason we give the ordinary beverages in daily use, in the
menus.</p>


<h3>BEVERAGES.</h3>

<p>Fruit juices are far more conductive to good health than tea or coffee,
and we especially recommend lemon juice diluted with boiling water as
a breakfast beverage, though we have not ventured to place it on the
regular bill of fare. It is a most appetising morning drink, and should
be taken a short time before eating.</p>

<p>This publication is intended to afford information as to the best food
to promote the physical, moral and spiritual welfare without destroying
the lives of other sensitive creatures.</p>


<p class="center">FOOD.</p>

<p>Its chief contention is that the fruits, nuts and grains, with a fair
proportion of fresh and preserved vegetable productions (with or
without the products of animals), are wholesome and pure. That flesh
meat contains the germs of diseases to which animals are subject and
contain the thick, venous blood, a substance so poisonous that it will
cause blood poisoning whenever it comes in contact with the arterial
blood of the body. That by avoiding the butcher’s meat and living
on the pure foods provided so abundantly in the Vegetable kingdom a
higher degree of health and strength can be obtained; a longer life and
greater freedom from irritation and nervous exhaustion, under pressure
of business or professional labor.</p>

<p>The principles of humanity towards animals and the effects of pure food
in promoting man’s ethical and spiritual progress are also discussed in
this magazine.</p>

the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for

easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away&#8212;you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work
on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
    are not located in the United States, you will have to check the laws
    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.
  </div>
</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this

active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; License.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.
</div>

provided that:

<div style='margin-left:0.7em;'>
    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

        &#8226; You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
        you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
        does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
        any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
        electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
        receipt of the work.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>

    </div>
</div>

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project

from the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the manager of
the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark. Contact the Foundation as set
forth in Section 3 below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you &#8216;AS-IS&#8217;, WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.
</div>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
