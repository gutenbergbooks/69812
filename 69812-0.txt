      “Thus the King’s will is:
  There hath been slaughter for the sacrifice
  And slaying for the meat, but henceforth none
  Shall spill the blood of life nor taste of flesh,
  Seeing that knowledge grows, and life is one,
  And mercy cometh to the merciful.”

                               PREFACE.


The aim of this book is to demonstrate the nutritious and appetising
possibilities of vegetable foods. Cattle are becoming so diseased that
apart from a humane revulsion against the consumption of meats in
daily food, man is being driven for his own welfare to seek purer food
substance. Any physical habit indulged in for generations is difficult
to overcome, and the transition period between daily meat eating, and
pure vegetarianism is a difficult one. We have endeavored to suggest
such a variety of tasty and nutritious foods as will materially aid in
making the change.

We do not claim this to be an exhaustive treatise on Vegetarian
Cookery; only a clear and practical aid in the better preparations of
some of the delicious products of the Vegetable Kingdom. Many children
show a natural dislike to meats, and Mothers are at a loss how to
supply them with proper nourishment when they reject the meat. Requests
have come to us for aid through this very fact; and was one of the
incentives to the bringing out of this book.

Mothers will have no difficulty in finding a plentiful variety of
relishable and nutritious foods for the children if they will study the
following pages. Equally easy will the formal dinner appear when one
wishes to entertain Vegetarian friends.




                             INTRODUCTORY.


Vegetarianism from a Theosophical standpoint involves a whole
philosophy of life. The short quotation on our title page well
expresses the theosophic concept of the Unity of life, and the law of
cause and effect which we call Karma. Life is fundamentally a unit,
and aught that works ill to any manifestation thereof has effect on
all. Through occult science we are taught a very practical lesson
of direct benefit to the individual, by a diet free from blood. As
clearly stated in Annie Besant’s manual on “Man and his Bodies,” man
molds these instruments of his will, or true self. These bodies are
but instruments; in no sense the man himself; and these instruments or
bodies are finely responsive to the operator, or true self, only as
they are purified and harmonized. Gross foods, and gluttony make gross
bodies, not only physical, but astral as well. For the astral bodies
feed on the subtle emanations of the foods supplying nutriment to the
physical encasement. If, through the consumption of meats we feed the
astral on the emanations of blood or animal life, we intensify the
gross desire-nature of the astral man, intensify the passional-nature,
and at death, when the physical body is cast aside as a discarded
garment, the dense, gross, astral body is held to corresponding planes
in the realm of the astral; thus the purgatory of the Roman church
becomes a very real and uncomfortable experience. If, on the contrary,
clean habits of life have purified the astral body, when it is
liberated at the hour of death from the prison house of flesh it is not
of the same degree of density as the lower astral planes, and it passes
on to the sunlit meadows of that world and away from its slums.

Alcohol has also a most pernicious effect on the astral vehicle, and
for that reason is eliminated from the food of the occultist. It is a
great mistake to give to the perishing, alcohol, or narcotics, as it
has really a more serious effect on the out-going astral than on the
physical encasement. When man learns to live on clean food, to have
clean habits and to think clean, generous thoughts, there is naught in
all this wonderful universe that he need fear.




                               PRACTICAL

                          VEGETARIAN COOKERY.




                                SOUPS.


SOUP STOCK.

Any nuts with herbs dried and ground will nicely flavor and enrich
stock.


STOCK FOR CLEAR SOUPS.

Place four onions in large kettle with a gallon of water, let boil
steadily two hours, then add one carrot, two small turnips, two
parsnips, three bay leaves, one head of celery (if celery leaves cannot
be had a saltspoonful of celery seeds may be used), one-eighth head
of cabbage. Let boil four hours; strain. This should make a gallon of
strong stock.


TOMATO BOUILLON.

Put one quart of tomatoes, with one and a half quarts of water, in
kettle over the fire; add one tablespoonful of chopped onion, two bay
leaves, four whole cloves, one level teaspoonful of celery seed and
a half teaspoonful of pepper. Cover and cook twenty minutes. Strain
through a sieve. Beat the whites of two eggs until partly light, add
them to the tomato, and boil rapidly for five minutes. Strain through
two thicknesses of cheese cloth. Reheat, season with two teaspoonfuls
of salt and serve with croutons.


JULIENNE SOUP.

Boil tender, not soft, one small potato, one small carrot, one half
cupful of green peas (canned peas can be used), and one small head of
celery, if in season; if in summer, asparagus heads will do. Cut the
large vegetables into small dice, and add one quart of the clear stock.
Take the yolks of two eggs, whipping them up with one tablespoonful of
milk with salt to taste, put in a crockery cup and set in steamer; let
cook until solid; set away to chill, then cut in small dice or fancy
shapes and add to the soup.


MACARONI SOUP.

One-third package of Macaroni, or Spaghetti; cook in boiling water,
salted to taste, until tender, then drain quickly and add one quart of
clear stock. Bring to a boiling point and serve.


TORONTO BISQUE.

Place a sauce pan, with half a cupful of fine chopped onion, the same
of carrot and celery, over the fire; cover with boiling water; cook
five minutes; drain off the water. Melt one tablespoonful of butter in
a saucepan, add the parboiled vegetables; cover and cook ten minutes,
stirring often; then add one heaping teaspoonful of flour, stir and
cook two minutes, add one cupful of canned tomatoes, and one quart of
boiling water, cook fifteen minutes. Shortly before serving rub the
bisque through a sieve; mix the yolk of two eggs with half a cupful of
cream; add it to the bisque, and stir for a few minutes over the fire.
In the meantime cook two ounces of macaroni in salted water thirty-five
minutes; drain and rinse it off with cold water; cut the macaroni into
small pieces the size of a white bean; add one cupful of this macaroni
to the bisque and serve.


TOMATO SOUP.

To one can of tomatoes add one pint of water, four peppercorns, one
half bay leaf, four cloves, and a bit of mace; cook until the tomatoes
are soft enough to strain. After straining add two teaspoonfuls of
sugar, one teaspoonful of salt, one fourth teaspoonful of soda; thicken
with two tablespoonfuls of butter and three tablespoonfuls of flour
blended together.


CREAM OF TOMATO.

To one half can of tomatoes, add one scant tablespoonful of finely
chopped onion, and three spikes of celery, cook until tender, then
strain through a wire sieve; season to taste, add soda the size of
a pea. Scald one quart of milk, mix one teaspoonful of butter with
heaping teaspoonful of flour, dissolve in warm milk and stir into the
scalding milk; add to the strained tomato stock just before serving;
don’t let it stand after milk is added. Serve with crackers.


DUTCH SOUP.

Take one bay leaf, one half can of tomatoes, one half can of corn, one
medium sized onion, chopped; two heads of celery, cut fine (or one half
teaspoonful of celery seed); one half cupful of rice, one half cupful
of oatmeal, one carrot, cut in dice, one eighth head of cabbage, cut
fine, one small turnip, cut fine, gallon, or more, of cold water, with
salt to taste. Cook gently until all vegetables are thoroughly tender.
Very nice served plain, or with dumplings. This soup is a hearty
luncheon in itself.


CREAM OF POTATO.

To one head of celery, cut fine, add one teaspoonful of chopped onion,
one large, or two medium sized potatoes, sliced; cook until you can
mash through a wire sieve; then add one quart of scalding milk, one
half cupful of cream, and thicken to a cream with buttered flour. Serve
with oyster crackers.


POTATO SOUP WITH DUMPLINGS.

Pare, wash, and cut into dice, six good sized potatoes, chop fine
one onion, place in kettle with water to cover, salt to taste, and
cook until tender; then add one quart of cream or rich milk, add one
tablespoonful of butter, a dash of pepper, and let come to a boil.

Have ready dumplings made as follows: To four heaping tablespoonfuls
of flour, add pinch of salt, one even teaspoonful baking powder, one
tablespoonful cream, and water enough to make soft dough; do not
knead, mould into small lumps, size of walnuts, and drop into soup
as soon as the soup comes to a boil. The dumplings take about eight
minutes to cook, and the kettle should be kept covered all the time.
The soup needs to be carefully watched that it does not boil over or
burn; it is well to lift the kettle free from the stove every three or
four minutes, giving it a little twirl, but do not lift the cover until
the eight minutes are passed, for sudden reduction of temperature may
make the dumplings heavy.


RICE POTATO SOUP.

To two tablespoonfuls of rice, thoroughly washed, add one potato cut in
large dice, one tablespoonful of finely chopped onion, and one-third of
a teaspoonful of celery seed; cook until tender, salt to taste, add one
quart of hot milk and one half cupful of cream. Serve with crackers.


SOUP WITH NOUILLES.

Nouilles--Beat two eggs, mix to a stiff paste with flour and a pinch of
salt, roll out very thin on well floured board, let dry a few minutes,
then roll snugly, cut from end of roll in strips as thin as possible,
and shake out thoroughly. Have one quart clear stock hot and shake

Take equal quantities of carrots, turnips, asparagus, peas and
cauliflowers. With a vegetable scoop cut the carrots and turnips into
pieces a quarter of an inch square, or turn them into the shapes of
olives, filberts, &c. Divide the cauliflowers and asparagus into small,
neat pieces. Cook the vegetables separately in plenty of water; when
tender drain and dry them; cover with white sauce and serve.


ESCALOPED ONIONS, CAULIFLOWER, OR ASPARAGUS.

Boil until tender, then put in baking dish and pour over sauce made of
one tablespoonful of butter rubbed into one and one half tablespoonfuls
of flour, pour over it one pint of hot milk, and cook until it is like
a custard. Sprinkle thick with bread crumbs and bake one half hour. Cut
the vegetables into small pieces before pouring over the sauce.




                              ASPARAGUS.


BAKED ASPARAGUS.

Place the asparagus with the root ends together in a baking dish;
sprinkle in salt and black pepper; mix two tablespoonfuls of flour
smoothly with soft butter to make a thin paste; spread it over the
asparagus; cover the dish with a plate; lay a weight on it; cook it
until the asparagus is very tender. It may be served in the dish in
which it is baked.


ASPARAGUS ON TOAST.

Cut away the hard ends; wash, then tie lightly together in a large
bunch with the heads all one way; set in deep kettle with the heads
up, fill with salted water to within two inches of the top of the
asparagus; cover and let boil until the stems are tender; the steam
will have cooked the tops. Have ready bread toasted a delicate brown
in the oven. Cut toast in strips about two inches wide, lay it on hot
shallow dish or platter, butter liberally, drain the asparagus and pile
it on the toast; sprinkle liberally with butter, pepper, and salt, and
serve with cut lemon.


ASPARAGUS WITH WHITE SAUCE.

Make a good crust and line a baking dish, fill with cooked asparagus,
dress with the white sauce; cover with top crust; and bake in hot oven.

baking powder, then a scant cupful of milk, and finally the boiled,
chopped tender tops of two bunches of asparagus. Put into a well
greased mould with a top, cook in a pot of boiling water two hours;
turn out and pour over it a cupful of drawn butter.




                                BEANS.


CREAMED STRING BEANS.

Cut the ends and string them. Put them in a covered saucepan with
water, and cook till tender, drain, and remove any strings that may
have adhered, then place again in the pan, add one cupful of cold milk,
and salt to taste; thicken with flour mixed smoothly with soft butter
to the consistency of thick cream; let them cook until the sauce is
thoroughly done, add a dash of pepper, and serve in hot covered dish.


WAX BEANS.

The yellow wax bean is very nice when young, prepare as you do any
string bean, stew until tender, letting liquor boil away and seasoning
with salt, pepper, and butter.


BOSTON BAKED BEANS.

Small navy beans are the best. Carefully pick over and wash one pint,
soak over night in enough water to cover; in the morning place in a
kettle with fresh water and boil for fifteen minutes; skim out of
this water, and put into an earthen crock, add one large spoonful
of molasses; one teaspoonful of mustard, salt to taste, and a large
heaping tablespoonful of butter with water enough to cover; place a
cover on the crock and set in the oven, cook them all day. They need
to be watched at intervals of half an hour to see that the water
is visible at the top of the beans; the last hour, if the oven is
moderate, no more water should be added.


DRIED LIMA BEANS.

One cupful is sufficient for a family of five. Wash and put to soak
over night. Steam in double boiler, with just water enough to float,
until thoroughly tender. Salt to taste and add one tablespoonful of
butter and a dash of pepper.

Dried beans can be freshened in an hour by soaking in hot water, and
renewing the water as soon as it cools.


FRESH LIMA BEANS.

Boil until tender in just water enough to float, when nearly done,
uncover and let water simmer away, add one cupful of sweet cream, and
salt to taste just before serving. If you do not have cream, use milk,
thickened with one teaspoonful of flour mixed with one tablespoonful of
soft butter.


SUCCOTASH.

Take one cupful of cold cooked lima beans; add one half can of sweet
corn, or equal quantity cut from cob; season to taste and add one
teaspoonful of butter and one cupful of milk; cook until the corn is
tender. Serve in hot, covered dish.




                                 CORN.


ROASTED CORN.

plate in which there is a sufficiency of melted butter; then place them
on a gridiron over a clean coal fire, and turn them until they are well
toasted.


CUT CORN.

CORN FRITTERS.

In the summer when fresh corn can be had, grate the corn from the cob
and mix in proportion of one cupful of grated corn to three well beaten
eggs; salt to taste and fry in hot butter by spoonfuls; serve hot.
They are much more delicate and delicious than where flour and milk are
used. The corn supplies both the milk and flour in its own substance.
Grated, or very tender, canned corn can be used in the same way in the
winter season.


BAKED CORN.

Chop as fine as possible the contents of one can of corn; add a heaping
tablespoonful of butter; season to taste; add one pint of milk; put in
baking dish; place in oven and bake until a nice brown.

a stiff froth; then mix well with the yolks, add to the warm corn and
milk mixture, put into a hot buttered baking dish and brown in quick
oven.


CORN ON TOAST.

Take pieces of bread four inches square and fry a delicate brown in
butter; then heap on the bread a large tablespoonful of stewed or
canned corn and heat through thoroughly; serve very hot.


CORN PATÊS.

season with salt and pepper; fill patê shells two thirds full and lay
piece of butter size of hickory nut on top of each filling; then pour
over each one a tablespoonful of cream; place in oven and bake till
delicate brown; serve hot. Very much like oysters.

If creamy dressing is preferred, omit the bread crumbs, and thicken the
cream with a little flour and butter before pouring over the corn, use
a little more cream to each shell.

in the palms of the hands, flatten them, pour beaten egg over them to
moisten both sides, turn each in a plate of powdered crackers, fry them
brown in boiling fat, and serve them on a hot shallow dish.




                                 PEAS.

                               POTATOES.


BOILED POTATOES.

Boiled potatoes are more nutritious when boiled in the skin. They
should be placed in a kettle with a sufficient amount of cold water to
cover them, salted to taste, cooked in an uncovered kettle, and the
water permitted to boil away; then let kettle remain on the back of
range where they will keep hot, until the potatoes are dry and mealy.
Peel before serving.


NEW POTATOES.

Small new potatoes with white skins need not be peeled, but should be
buttered liberally and served in a hot dish.


MASHED POTATOES.

Boil until tender and place in colander, have ready a large bowl with
tablespoonful of butter and half a cupful of cream; mash through the
colander into a bowl, then whip potatoes and seasoning thoroughly
with a fork, as a spoon destroys the delicacy; place in dish and set
uncovered over steam to heat thoroughly. Serve quickly.


POTATO CROQUETTES.

To one pint of hot mashed potatoes add one tablespoonful of butter, one
half saltspoonful of pepper, one half teaspoonful of salt, one dash of

egg; add one teaspoonful of chopped parsley. Shape into croquettes,
roll in fine bread crumbs, then in a mixture of egg and milk, roll
again in bread crumbs, let stand about fifteen minutes in a cold place,
then fry by plunging in very hot fat for a moment. Do not fry more than
three at a time, in order not to chill the fat. Drain carefully.


POTATO PATÊS.

shaping it like a ball; then with a teaspoon take out a good part of
the center. Fill this potato patê shell with minced onion and celery
cooked tender in butter, and add a grating of cheese; season to taste,
then cover it over with potato; dip into melted butter and egg; place
in a shallow baking pan and place in a hot oven, let come to a nice
brown; serve on platter garnished with parsley.


SARATOGA CHIPS.

warm place to drain; sprinkle lightly with salt.


PRINCESS POTATOES.

Boil and mash the desired quantity; while the potatoes are still warm
spread them half an inch thick on a plate and set away to cool. When

beaten egg, finally placing them in a baking pan and browning them in a
hot oven.


WACHTMEISTER POTATOES.

Select potatoes of medium size and perfect shape; scour the skins,
and steam until tender, then place in oven until skin is slightly
toughened; remove from oven and open at one end, carefully removing
contents, do not break the skins. Have ready a bowl of whipped cream;
mash the potatoes and mix freely with whipped cream. Stuff back in
potato skins and set in shallow dish, open ends up; place back in
oven and let them get thoroughly hot, then serve. One who has been
a strict vegetarian for years finds salt a poison; and it is omitted
intentionally in the “Wachtmeister” receipt. It can of course be added
to potato in mixing for those who desire it.


POTATOES IN WHITE SAUCE.

Peel and quarter potatoes, put them into saucepan (with salt, if

teaspoonful of ginger; grate the potato into the flour mixture; let
the hot water boil briskly for one minute, strain it over the flour
and potato mixture, and mix thoroughly; if it does not thicken like
starch, place it over the fire for a few minutes, stirring briskly. If
too thick, add boiling water till thin as cream. When lukewarm or at 70
degrees, add one half cake of yeast. Raise in a warm place till frothy,
beat it down every half hour. Bottle and keep in a cool place.


THREE HOUR BREAD.

Pour one cupful of boiling water over two tablespoonfuls of flour and
beat well; when this becomes lukewarm add two teaspoonfuls of sugar and
one yeast cake that has been dissolved in one half cupful of lukewarm
water. Beat thoroughly, add flour enough to make a thick batter, beat
until light and set in a warm place, about 90 degrees F. Keep covered
and let rise until light and frothy, with this proportion of yeast it
should rise in thirty minutes. When light add one cupful of scalded
milk, cooled to lukewarm, and flour enough to make a stiff dough; stir
in the flour with a spoon, beating it thoroughly; when the dough begins
to stiffen, cut in the flour with a bread knife; add flour until the
dough slips easily from the board, and does not stick to the hands.
Then knead the dough on a slightly floured board until smooth, elastic,
and full of air bubbles. Knead it firmly, but lightly, using only the
wrist movements, put back in bowl, cover, and let rise in warm place
until it doubles in bulk; shape into loaves, or biscuit; brush lightly
with melted butter, and place in warm buttered pan. Let rise, closely
covered, until loaves have doubled in bulk. Bake in an oven hot enough
to brown one teaspoonful of flour placed on a piece of paper, in five
minutes. If biscuits are to be baked, the oven should be hot enough to
brown flour in two minutes. Let the bread bake from forty-five minutes
to one hour. The first quarter of the time the bread should rise, but
not form a crust; the second quarter the crust should form; the third
the crust should become golden brown; the fourth should complete the
baking. Place the loaf to cool uncovered, and in such a position that
the air can circulate freely around it, bottom and all.


WHOLE WHEAT BREAD.

Make a sponge of one half cupful lukewarm water, one half yeast cake
dissolved in one fourth cupful lukewarm water, and one cupful of white
flour; cover; and set in warm place,--about 90 degrees F.--until light
and foamy; add one half cupful scalded milk, cooled to lukewarm, one
half teaspoonful of salt and whole wheat flour to make a stiff dough;
knead thoroughly, put into warm place, let rise until it doubles
in bulk; mould into a loaf, put into a warm buttered pan, and keep
closely covered in warm place until it rises sufficiently to double
in size; put into a hot oven; at the end of fifteen minutes lower the
temperature of oven and bake at least forty-five minutes longer. This
makes one loaf.


ENGLISH UNFERMENTED GRIDDLE BREAD.

This bread is usually made from whole wheat flour. It is cooked on a
griddle, hence its name “Griddle Bread.” The griddle should be made
thoroughly hot before placing the dough on it, and sprinkled with a
little fine white flour. Measure the meal, and for every two level
measures of meal allow one measure of boiling water; have the meal in
a mixing bowl, and use a wooden spoon for stirring. Make a hole in
the center of the meal and pour the boiling water into it, stirring
all the time till it forms a mass or lump. No kneading is required.
Sprinkle the paste-board with fine white flour and turn the mass onto
it. Roll out into cakes, making the cake about half an inch thick. The
edge should not be ragged, but dredged with fine flour and pressed
with the knuckles to an even thickness. Dredge fine flour on each
piece, rub it well in with the fingers, then turn it on the other side
with the knife and do the same, so that the surface has a fine smooth
appearance. As each piece is prepared, place it on the hot griddle
plate. Two or three minutes is sufficient time to prepare the bread
from the moment the water boils. The time for the cooking necessarily
varies according to the heat of the fire, which should be kept at an
even temperature; twenty to thirty minutes will be found the average.


TEA ROLLS.

Make a sponge of one cupful of lukewarm water, one cake of yeast,
one fourth cupful sugar, and flour enough to make a soft dough. When
sufficiently raised add a little over a cupful of softened butter, and
three fourths of a cupful of luke warm milk and enough flour to keep
it a sponge. Beat well and let rise; then add beaten white of one egg
and enough flour to knead. Knead thoroughly and let it rise again; work
down; place in a buttered bowl; let it rise again, turn onto a board,
roll, and cut. Shape to suit fancy, in finger rolls, bread sticks, or
cleft rolls; place in pans and let rise; bake in hot oven. For Cinnamon
Rolls, make as above only roll out one fourth inch in thickness and
spread with softened butter, sugar, cinnamon, and currants. All bread
stuffs brown better if brushed over with melted butter.

spongy in the cuts, and seem full of air; turn it out on a well floured
board, toss with knife until well floured, pat with rolling pin, and
when dough is about half an inch thick, cut it into rounds and bake at
once in hot oven.

                           CAKES AND ICINGS.


CAKES.

Thin cakes require a hotter oven than those baked in thick loaves.
Cakes with molasses in them burn more quickly than others. Thin cakes
should bake from fifteen to twenty minutes, thicker cakes from thirty
to forty minutes, and very thick loaves about one hour. If only the
yolks of the eggs are used the cake is richer, if only the whites it
is lighter. Have all ingredients ready, then see that fire and oven
are right, and mix carefully. The secret of fine grained cake is in
the mixing. First always cream the butter by beating, then add sugar
slowly, creaming carefully, then add the well beaten yolks of eggs.
Sift the flour and baking powder together three times, at least, then
add alternately in small quantities the flour and milk, and last of
all the stiffly beaten whites of eggs, working them in as lightly as
possible.

of baking powder; put flour and baking powder through sifter three
times. Add flour and one cupful of milk slowly and alternately to
butter mixture, adding last of all the whites of egg beaten stiff and
one teaspoonful of flavoring. Bake in loaf in moderate oven for thirty
minutes.


ORANGE CAKE.

cupfuls of flour, into which two rounded teaspoonfuls of baking powder
has been sifted, and one cupful of milk; last of all add the whites of
the three eggs, beaten to a stiff froth, folding them into the dough
lightly. Bake in shallow pans for about twenty minutes, or until cake
shrinks from the pan. Put together with orange icing.


IDA’S CAKE.

Beat the whites of four eggs very stiff and set in refrigerator to
chill; cream the yolks; add one cupful of sugar and a teaspoonful of

board, pat, and roll till one fourth inch thick, then distribute one
teaspoonful of butter over the surface. Sprinkle with flour and fold
over and over, roll out again into a long strip, then roll like a jelly
roll, and cut from end as needed, and roll out from end. The secret of
good pastry is to thoroughly chill material.

For all fruit and custard pies brush bottom crust with white of egg
before putting in filling. The crust will then remain dry and delicate.


A RICH PUFF PASTE.

One quart of flour and one pound of butter; sift the flour and work in
the yolk of an egg well beaten; mix with ice water and roll out to the
thickness of an inch or less. After the butter has been worked in cold
water to extract the salt, place it on one half of the dough, folding
the other half over it, set away for fifteen minutes in an ice chest,
or other equally cold place, and then roll out into a long strip, which
fold into three parts by turning over each end and rolling each fold;
repeat this operation six or seven times. The colder the dough can be
kept while being worked in this way, the better will be the results.


MINCE PIES.

To one cupful of water add one cupful of molasses, one cupful of
sugar, one beaten egg, one cupful of vinegar, two and one half Boston
crackers, rolled fine, one cupful of stoned raisins, butter the size
of an egg, one quarter of a teaspoonful of cloves; two thirds of a
teaspoonful of cinnamon; two thirds of a teaspoonful of allspice.

This will make three pies. The pies should bake slowly, taking about
three quarters of an hour. A grating of nutmeg should be added to each
pie before putting on upper crust. The egg, cracker, and slow baking
thickens this apparently thin mixture.


FRUIT PIE.

Carefully wash two thirds of a cupful of dried currants, add equal
quantity of seeded raisins; with one cupful of sugar and one cupful of
water; place in saucepan and boil gently for one half hour; remove from
the fire and add two tablespoonfuls of vinegar, with cinnamon, cloves,
allspice, and nutmeg to taste; two chopped apples, one tablespoonful of
rolled crackers, half a cupful of chopped, sweet pickled peaches, or
any preserved or spiced fruit; bake with two crusts. This will make two
pies.


CREAM PIE.

Make a boiled custard, with one pint of milk, yolks of two eggs well
beaten, and three tablespoonfuls of sugar, place in double boiler and
thicken with one tablespoonful of flour that has been blended with
melted butter, add one half teaspoonful of vanilla, let cook until
flour is thoroughly done (if too thick a little more milk can be
added). Have ready a baked pastry, fill with the mixture; then whip
the whites of the two eggs to a very stiff froth and add one half
cupful sugar and a few drops of flavoring, spread over the pie; set in
oven just long enough to set the frosting and touch it with delicate
brown. Serve cold. A chocolate pie can be made after the same method
by omitting the yolks of the eggs and beating into hot milk one-fourth
cake of chocolate.


CUSTARD PIE.

Beat three eggs until light, add three tablespoonfuls of sugar and beat
again. Then grate sufficient nutmeg to flavor, and add three cupfuls of
scalded milk. Bake slowly in single crust; as soon as the custard puffs
and a knife blade can be dipped in and comes out clean, it is done.


LEMON PIE.

Beat the yolks of three eggs until thick, add one cupful of sugar and
the grated yellow rind of one large lemon (be very careful not to
grate any of the white of the lemon skin or it will make pie bitter),
also the juice; beat until thick and light colored, then add one
tablespoonful of corn starch, dissolved in a little water. Pour into a
pie shell and bake slowly until it puffs. Beat the whites of the eggs
until light, then gradually add three tablespoonfuls of sugar and beat
until stiff. When the pie is slightly cooled, cover with this frosting,
return to oven, and let it get a very delicate brown. Serve cold.


SQUASH PIE.

To one and one half cupfuls of prepared squash, add one cupful of
scalded milk, one half cupful of sugar, one saltspoonful of cinnamon,
a dash of nutmeg and cloves, and one egg well beaten, pour in egged
crust, and bake thirty minutes, or until it puffs up all over. Sweet
potato may be used in place of squash. To prepare squash or sweet
potato, steam and mash.


RIPE CURRANT PIE.

To one cupful of the fruit, washed and removed from stems, add one
cupful of sugar; one cupful of cream, and one tablespoonful of flour;
bake with only an under crust.


NEUFCHATEL CHEESE PIE.

One Neufchatel cheese, one teacupful of sugar, grate the rind of one
lemon and use with it one half of the juice, half a teacupful each
of rolled cracker crumbs, and currants, four eggs, one tablespoonful
melted butter, half a teacupful of cream, or rich milk, half a nutmeg
grated and one saltspoonful of salt. Crumble the cheese and cracker
crumbs well together, beat the eggs with the sugar and add to cracker
mixture, following with the butter and cream. If the cream is very rich
the butter may be omitted. Lastly, add lemon, nutmeg and currants. The
currants should previously be washed, dried and dusted with flour. Mix
all well together and put into well buttered patty-pans that have been
lined with puff-paste. Bake fifteen or twenty minutes in a quick oven.
They will puff up, but must not be permitted to get too brown.


PINE-APPLE TART.

Line a pie plate with pastry, and fill with mixture made of one ounce
of butter, and one half cupful of sugar beaten to a cream; the well
beaten yolks of five eggs, a grated pineapple, one teacupful of cream
and add last of all the whites of the eggs beaten stiff and folded in
lightly, with a little more sugar.


ALMOND PEACH PIE.

Line a pie dish with puff or good plain paste, lay halves of canned
peaches, with the stone side up all over the bottom of the crust;
fill the cavity where the pit was with a spoonful of chopped almonds;
sprinkle with sugar and pour over a very little of the peach juice;
cover with a crust, and bake till a nice brown; serve with, or without
cream.




                               PUDDINGS.


IRISH MOSS JELLY.

Pick over and wash carefully one half cupful of Irish Moss. Put it into
one pint of boiling water, add the thin yellow rind cut from one lemon,
and one cupful of sugar; simmer until the moss is dissolved, add the
juice of lemon and a grating of nutmeg, and strain into a cold, wet,
mould. Set away to harden; serve plain, or with cream. Orange may be
used in place of lemon, though a dessert spoonful of lemon juice used
with the orange improves the flavor. This Irish Moss may be substituted
in place of gelatine in all delicate puddings calling for that animal
product; it is to be had at any druggist’s.


SAGO MILK.

Soak a cupful of sago in a quart of cold milk; put in a double boiler
with one cupful of sugar; cook until the sago is dissolved; pour it
into a dish, and stir in ten drops of the essence of lemon or vanilla.
Serve it hot or cold.


SAGO JELLY.

Soak a cupful of sago in a quart of cold water over night; boil in
double boiler for an hour; then uncover it for the water to boil away.
Add two cupfuls of sugar and the strained juice of a lemon; pour it
into a dish in which it may be served. Serve it cold, with smooth fresh
cream, sweetened and flavored.


ORANGE FOAM (FOR TWELVE PERSONS).

To the juice of twelve oranges (the small, tart ones are best) add
the juice of one lemon, the grated yellow rind of two oranges, and
three cupfuls of sugar. Whip till very light the yolks of twelve eggs;
then whip in the prepared juice. Whip the whites of eggs as stiff as
possible (keep them well chilled while whipping) and beat in lightly,
yet thoroughly, the prepared mixture. Serve in punch glasses with lady
fingers. Place half of a lady finger in bottom of each glass. The
amount of sugar used may vary according to the flavor of the oranges.
If the foam is not stiff, then add more whites of eggs. It is difficult
to give exact quantities because the flavor and juiciness of the fruit
varies so. This should be prepared just before serving.


NEAPOLITAN PUDDING.

Dissolve a cupful of currant jelly in a cupful of hot water; thicken
with dissolved corn starch (be careful not to use too much corn starch,
only just enough to make it stiff when chilled). Have ready a chilled
mold, pour in the mixture as soon as the starch is thoroughly cooked,
and the white of one egg, whipped till very stiff, is added to the
mixture. Then make an equal quantity of strong sweet lemonade, bringing
this to a scald, thicken the same way, adding egg in same manner; pour
this as second layer in mold. Then take two cupfuls of milk, bring to a
scald, sweeten, and thicken as before, then add the yolks of two eggs,
well beaten, whipping in one half teaspoonful of vanilla flavoring,
add to previous layers in mould (the layers can be placed in order to
suit fancy), set away to chill thoroughly, and serve with whipped or
plain cream. Other fruit flavors can be used in same way--pineapple or
apricot syrups are very nice.

three eggs, beaten to a stiff froth, whip in thoroughly, and pour into
a chilled, wet mould; when firm and cold, turn out and serve with cold
boiled custard and jelly, or cream and sugar.


ORANGE SOUFFLÉ.

Make a boiled custard with the yolks of five eggs, a quart of milk, and
sugar to taste. When cool pour it over four sliced oranges, from which
all seeds and tough fibre have been removed, and to which has been
added one cupful of sugar, and grated rind of one orange. Place this
in baking dish, cover with a meringue made of the whites of four eggs;
then place the dish in a shallow pan of cold water and put in oven
until the meringue is a golden brown. Serve cold.

Roast the chestnuts, then grate to powdered flakes, heaping lightly
in middle of pudding dish, surround with apricot jam, and serve with
whipped cream.

fruits, as you prefer; sprinkle one half the fruit in the buttered
mould, then break in stale cake or bread crumbs, mixing with it the
rest of the fruit, filling the mould lightly. Then whip up three eggs,
add to them three tablespoonfuls of sugar and three cupfuls of milk,
pour over the cake and fruit mixture. Let stand one hour, then steam
for one and one fourth hours. Serve hot with creamy sauce.


COLD CABINET PUDDING.

stir this into one half cupful of milk; melt two ounces of chocolate
and stir into the milk; put on stove, and cook till it thickens; beat
till cool, flavor with vanilla and spread on the cake between layers
and sprinkle confectioners’ sugar on top. Plain Washington pie has
simply a dressing of whipped cream, sweetened, and flavored with
vanilla, between the layers.


STRAWBERRY CREAM CAKE.

Make cake the same as for any good layer cake. For the filling take one
cupful of thick sweet cream, whip until stiff, add four tablespoonfuls
of fine grained granulated sugar and one pint of strawberries, crushed
slightly, and sweetened. When cake is perfectly cold spread between
layers. This should not stand long before serving.

serve within an hour.


CONNECTICUT INDIAN PUDDING.

Add to three tablespoonfuls of cornmeal, three fourths of a cupful of
molasses and a little salt; mix well; put one generous quart of milk in

Make one quart of strong sweet lemonade, bring to a scalding point,
add juice of one orange. Thicken with dissolved cornstarch, the same
as any cornstarch pudding; being careful not to make too stiff. Have
ready the whites of two eggs, beaten very stiff. When the corn starch
is thoroughly cooked, set the dish off the stove and whip in the
eggs. Then slice in two bananas, pour in moulds, set away to chill
thoroughly, serve with cream and sugar. This is quite as delicious as
any gelatine pudding.


CREAM RICE PUDDING.

Two cupfuls of milk, two tablespoonfuls of rice, two tablespoonfuls
of sugar, one half saltspoonful grated nutmeg, one half cupful stoned
raisins. Stir frequently. When it begins to thicken add more milk,

cupfuls of milk, two well beaten eggs, one tablespoonful of vanilla and
one half cupful of seeded raisins; bake in moderate oven about three
quarters of an hour.


SNOW BALLS.

Cook one cupful of rice until tender. Wring small pudding cloths (one
third yard square) out of hot water and lay over a small bowl. Spread
rice one third of an inch thick over cloth. Put an apricot in the
center, filling in each half of apricot with rice. Tie tightly and
steam ten minutes. Remove the cloth carefully and turn the balls out on
a platter, and serve with apricot sauce. Canned apricots may be used.
If fresh fruit is preferred steam the apricots tender before removing
stones.


CREAM PUDDING.

Stir together one pint of cream, three ounces of sugar, the well beaten
yolks of three eggs, with scant teaspoonful of vanilla flavoring. Whip
the whites of the eggs very light and add last, stirring lightly. Pour

sprinkled bread crumbs to the thickness of ordinary pie crust. Sprinkle
bread crumbs over the top of pudding, set dish in shallow pan half
filled with water, and bake the same as any custard.


FRENCH BREAD PUDDING.

Butter small thin squares of bread and spread with jam, or tart
jelly; place them in a buttered pudding dish; have the dish about
one half full; pour over a boiled custard (using the yolks only for
the custard); beat the whites of two eggs, adding gradually two
tablespoonfuls of powdered sugar; beat one large tablespoonful of the
jam or jelly used; heap on top of the custard and brown slightly in the
oven.




                         SAUCES FOR PUDDINGS.


APRICOT SAUCE.

Take one cupful of apricot juice, thicken with one teaspoonful of corn
starch and sweeten with one half cupful of sugar; let boil until clear.


HARD SAUCE.

Beat together one half cupful of butter and one cupful of sugar until
it is creamy and white; flavor with one teaspoonful of vanilla extract.


CREAMY SAUCE.

Cream one half cupful of butter, then stir in one cupful of powdered
sugar, a little at a time, and beat until very light. Then add one
fourth cupful of cream or milk and one scant teaspoonful of vanilla
flavoring. Just before serving set the bowl in a pan of hot water, and
as soon as the sauce is smooth and creamy remove from fire. It should
not be heated enough to melt the sugar.


GINGER SAUCE.

Chop finely one fourth cupful of preserved ginger; add one cupful of
water and a quarter cupful of sugar, and boil for five minutes. Pour
it over the well beaten whites of two eggs, add two tablespoonfuls of
lemon juice, and chill.


CURRANT JELLY SAUCE.

Put four tablespoonfuls currant jelly in a saucepan with one
teaspoonful of butter; let it heat and melt slowly; pour over one half
cupful of boiling water, moisten one teaspoonful of cornstarch with a
little cold water; add to the other ingredients and cook five minutes;
add the juice of one orange, grated peel of one half orange and one and
one half tablespoonfuls blanched almonds finely chopped.


EGG SAUCE.

One cupful of sugar, a tablespoonful of butter, two eggs, a little
salt, and a teaspoonful of vanilla, or any flavoring preferred. Mix the
butter and sugar to a cream, add the yolks of the eggs, and beat until
very light. Beat the whites to a stiff froth and stir in, add flavoring
and beat well together. This is especially good for apple or berry
dumplings. Lemon is nice to flavor it when used for apple puddings, but
should not be used for other fruits. When a plainer sauce is desired,
leave out the butter.




                            APPLE DESSERTS.


STEAMED APPLES.

Wash, pare, and remove cores of six tart apples; place in earthen dish
and put in steamer, over boiling water. Steam until soft. Serve with
steamed oatmeal or boiled rice, and cream and sugar.


BAKED APPLES.

Wash, and core sour apples. Place them in earthen or granite dish and
fill the center of each apple with sugar. Measure one tablespoonful
of water for each apple and pour around the apples (not over, as you
should not disturb the sugar in apple centers). Bake until tender,
remove apples to the dish in which they will be served at table. Strain
the juice, add one third cupful of sugar. Cook five minutes, and pour
it over the apples, let cool, and serve with cream.


APPLE FRITTERS.

Core, pare, and cut apple into slices one fourth inch thick, sprinkle
with sugar and cinnamon or nutmeg, and set them aside while making
batter.

Beat the yolks of two eggs, add one tablespoonful sugar, one half
cupful of sweet milk, and enough flour to make it almost a drop batter.
Melt one tablespoonful of butter and add to mixture. Beat in the well
whipped whites of two eggs. Dip each slice of apple into the batter,
see that it is well covered and quickly drop into a kettle in which is
sufficient hot cocoa butter or vegetable oil to float it; fry until
the apple is soft, and the fritter a light brown on both sides. Drain,
trim, and sprinkle with pulverized sugar. Serve hot.


APPLE DUMPLINGS BAKED.

Select moderate sized, tart apples; pare, core, and steam until tender,
not soft; have ready a plain pie crust rolled thin in pieces size of
small pie plate. Place one apple on each piece of crust, fill the core
with sugar, spice to taste and add teaspoonful of hot water to sugar.
Wrap crust about the apple pinching it together, place in hot oven and
bake until crust is well cooked; serve hot with hard sauce.


APPLE SLUMP.

Cut apples as for pies and fill a rich undercrust of a good thickness;
cover with a thick topcrust and bake in a slow oven for about an hour;
when baked remove the top crust, add sugar and spice, and butter half
the size of an egg, mix with the apple; then remove part of the apple.
Place the top crust in an inverted way upon what remains, and the apple
that has been taken out on top of that. Should be eaten hot.


APPLE RICE.

Fill a pudding dish half full with tart apples, pared, quartered, and
sprinkled thickly with sugar, and a grating of nutmeg. Wash thoroughly
half a cupful of rice and sprinkle over apples in pudding dish. Steam
until rice is tender. Serve with cream and sugar.


APPLE CREAM.

Place in an enamelled pan with a wineglassful of water, one pound and
a half of minced apple, half a pound of pulverized sugar, the finely
minced rind of half a lemon, and a quarter of an ounce of ginger
powder; simmer gently till soft enough to pass through a sieve. When
cold, beat in thoroughly one pint of cold fresh cream, or new milk
which has previously been brought to a boil, and sweetened.


APPLE FLUMMERY.

To two pounds of peeled and cored apples add one pound of sugar, and
the minced rind of a fresh lemon; place in an enamelled pan, cover
with water and steam till quite soft, strain and beat the fruit to a
pulp. Boil in the strained liquor one ounce of Irish moss for fifteen
minutes, strain the liquor again, and add the crushed fruit, simmer for
three minutes, turn into a chilled and wet mould. Let stand until solid
and well chilled. Serve with cream.




                             SHORT CAKES.


Take one quart of flour, one teaspoonful of salt, one pint of rich
sour cream; dissolve one teaspoonful of soda in a little boiling water
and stir into the cream; dissolve one tablespoonful of butter and add
to cream; then stir in flour, roll out as you would for biscuit; bake
in round pan in two layers, spreading butter between the layers; when
baked, take apart and spread with any prepared fruits.

If preferred, sweet milk and baking powder may be used in place of the
sour cream and soda. And the following is an excellent receipt:


RACHEL’S SHORT-CAKE.

Two cupfuls of flour, one third cupful of butter, two well rounded
teaspoonfuls of baking powder, one cupful of milk, one half teaspoonful
of salt. Roll in two layers one half inch thick, butter well between
layers and on the top and bake.


STRAWBERRY FILLING.

Mash one quart of strawberries in an earthen dish, add sufficient sugar
to make a rich sweetness, set the dish in the oven until the dish is
heated through, butter each half of the short-cake, covering with the
crushed fruit, and putting a liberal supply on top, sprinkle with
pulverized sugar, and serve with cream.


ORANGE FILLING.

Get small, tart, juicy oranges, pare half dozen or more, carefully
remove all the white, and slice; take out all the seeds and tough
fibre; then crush with enough sugar to make very sweet.

Place in agate saucepan and set on back of range to get thoroughly hot;
butter the short cake liberally and apply filling between layers and on
top; serve with whipped cream.


CRANBERRY FILLING.

Wash the berries and pick them over carefully; cook in agate saucepan
with water enough to float over a moderate fire; mash through a
colander; then add sufficient sugar to make very rich and sweet; set
back on range until sugar is thoroughly dissolved; butter short-cake
liberally and apply filling between layers and on top.


PINEAPPLE FILLING.

Get a ripe pineapple; pare and slice; then shred with a silver fork;
cover thickly with sugar, and set away for three or four hours; then
set on range in an agate kettle to heat thoroughly; butter short-cake
liberally, and apply filling between layers and on top; serve with
whipped cream. Canned pineapple may be used, though the fresh fruit is
best.


BANANA FILLING.

Slice three bananas and one orange, grate the outside rind of the
orange and mix with one cupful of sugar, and juice of orange; pour on
the sliced bananas. Butter the short-cake and fill with the fruit thus
prepared. Serve plain, or with whipped cream.




                                 ICES.


WATER ICES.

The simplest way of making fruit ices is much the best. Take one pint
of water to one quart of fruit juice, sweetened to taste; and it should
be remembered the sugar is less apparent in the frozen mixture than
in the liquid. This proportion holds for all fruit ices; except the
lemon. The lemon prepare as you would a rich lemonade, adding the well
beaten whites of two eggs to each quart of the mixture. Be careful to
freeze smoothly and the ices will be delicious. I especially recommend
strawberry, pineapple, apricot, orange and lemon.


UNCOOKED CREAM.

To one quart of cream, add one teaspoonful of vanilla flavoring, and
one cupful of sugar. If you have a freezer that stirs with the triple
movement in freezing, it is unnecessary to whip the cream. Otherwise it
should be partially whipped before being placed in freezer.


FRENCH CREAM.

Scald one pint of milk in double boiler; beat two eggs with one cupful
of sugar until light; then whip in two tablespoonfuls of flour; turn
into hot milk and stir until it thickens, cook fifteen minutes and set
away to cool. When cold add one quart of whipped cream, and one cupful
more of sugar with one tablespoonful of vanilla flavoring; freeze.


CHOCOLATE CREAM.

To make chocolate cream add to the above, when the custard is being
prepared, one ounce of dissolved sweet chocolate that has been
cooked to a gloss with one tablespoonful of boiling water and two
tablespoonfuls of sugar. Omit the second cupful of sugar usually added
with cream.


WACHTMEISTER PUDDING.

Fill a mould with alternate layers of sponge cake and jam,--strawberry
or apricot, are preferable,--then saturate with rich cream flavored
with vanilla and sweetened. Freeze in moulds. Custard may be used in
place of cream.


FROZEN FRUITS.

To one pound of mashed fruit, add whites of three eggs, and one pint
each of sugar and water. Make a syrup of the sugar and water; when
cool, add the fruit and freeze.

With sweet fruits like oranges or raspberries, add juice of one lemon
and one half cupful more of sugar. The fruit is very nice, without the
addition of the eggs.


PINEAPPLE SHERBET.

To one quart of grated pineapple pulp, add juice of two lemons;
dissolve one and one half pounds of sugar in one pint of water, and
bring to a boil, skim and cool; when cold, add the fruit pulp, and the
well whipped whites of two eggs; freeze soft.


STRAWBERRY SHERBET.

Crush a pound of picked strawberries in a basin and add a quart of
water with a sliced lemon, let stand for three hours; put one and one
quarter pounds of sugar into another basin, cover the basin with a
cheese cloth and pour the berry juice through it. When the sugar is
fully dissolved strain again. Freeze soft.




                             CONFECTIONS.


CANDY DOUGH.

To the white of one egg placed in a glass add equal quantity of cold
water, or better yet, rich, sweet cream, and one teaspoonful of vanilla
extract. Beat thoroughly; then stir in gradually enough confectioner’s
XXXX sugar to make stiff. Cover with damp napkin and use as needed for
the following varieties:


CHOCOLATE CREAMS.

Mould small pieces of candy dough into the shape of thimbles, put them
on a buttered pan or paraffine paper in a cool place to harden. Melt
two squares of sweet chocolate in a saucer over a tea kettle. When the
cream balls are sufficiently hard, dip them in the melted chocolate.
Use two forks. Let the candies drain on the forks, then put them on the
tins again to dry.


CREAM WALNUTS.

Break pieces of candy dough to the size of a nutmeg, roll them in the
palm of the hand until smooth and round. Press halved walnut meats on
each side, letting cream show between.


CREAM ALMONDS.

Mould almond nut into center of a small ball of candy dough. Roll in
granulated sugar and set away to dry.

roll in confectioner’s sugar.


ORANGE CREAMS.

Take the white of one egg and an equal quantity of orange juice, and
grated yellow rind of one orange, mix with confectioner’s sugar until a
stiff dough. Mould in shapely lumps and roll in granulated sugar. This
also serves for orange flavored filling for chocolate drops. Any fruit
juice can be used in this same way. Any flavor desired that cannot be
obtained readily from fresh fruit can be had by using extract with
white of egg and cream base.


CHOCOLATE ANNAS.

To three cupfuls of white sugar, add one cupful of milk and one fourth
teaspoonful of cream of tartar, boil about nine minutes, or until
it will form a soft ball when dropped into cold water; then add two
squares of melted chocolate and one tablespoonful of butter. Cook one
minute longer. Remove from fire, add one teaspoonful vanilla extract,
beat vigorously for one minute, then pour into buttered pans. When
cool mark in squares.


MOLASSES CANDY.

Two cupfuls of molasses, one cupful of sugar, one teaspoonful of
vinegar, one tablespoonful of butter. Boil until it is brittle when
tried in cold water. Pour in a buttered tin; when cool pull until white.

minutes, stirring constantly; when almost done stir in three quarters
of a cupful of chopped walnuts or chopped blanched almonds; remove from
the fire and stir till it grains, and looks sugary, then pour into a
well oiled tin to the depth of half an inch; when it cools mark off in
squares with a knife.


LEMON MINTS.

Sift a quantity of confectioner’s sugar into a bowl and work into it
lemon juice until all sugar is absorbed, then add water, a very little
at a time, until a smooth, stiff paste is formed. A bit of the lemon
peel may be grated into it. Roll into balls and flatten, placing them
in the oven a moment to harden.


SOFT CARAMELS.

One quart of brown sugar, half a pint of milk, one third cupful of
butter, and half a cake of chocolate. Boil about nine minutes, but not
so long that you cannot pour them into the pan. Mark into squares.


BUTTER SCOTCH.

Two cupfuls of light brown sugar, one cupful of butter, one
tablespoonful of lemon juice and one of water. Mix all together and
boil twenty minutes, add one fourth teaspoonful of baking soda, drop
a little in water and if it is crisp it is ready to take off. If not,
cook longer; when done, pour into a flat buttered tin.


MARSHMALLOWS.

Three ounces of gum-arabic, half a pint of hot water, half a pint
of powdered sugar, the white of one egg, flavoring. Dissolve the
gum-arabic in the water, strain, and add the sugar. Boil ten minutes or
until the syrup has the consistency of honey, stirring all the time.
Add the egg, beaten stiff, and as soon as thoroughly mixed remove from
the fire; add flavoring to taste, orange flower or rose is generally
used. Pour the paste into a pan dusted with corn starch. The paste
should be spread one inch thick. Cut into squares when cold, and roll
in powdered sugar.


CHOC-O-POP.

Have ready a mixture made of one cupful of sugar, one half cupful of
molasses and one cake of chocolate, cooked until it nearly crisps in
cold water, keep warm. Pop corn enough to fill a three quart bowl, turn
into a big pan and mix with the candy.


CRACKER-JACK.

Is made in the same way, only use one third sugar to two thirds
molasses and omit the chocolate.


FROSTED FRUITS.

Carefully pick over and wash the fruit, such as cherries, plums or
strawberries. Whip the whites of two or three eggs, according to
quantity of fruit; dip the fruit in beaten egg, drain (keep the eggs
well beaten) then dip fruit into powdered sugar. Cover a pan with a
sheet of white paper, place the fruit on glass dish; dry, chill, and
serve.


STUFFED DATES.

Wash and carefully dry the dates by placing them in a colander and
letting stand in warm place; remove the stones and insert half a pecan,
or one fourth of an English walnut; roll in confectioner’s sugar.


SALTED ALMONDS.

Blanch half a pound of almonds by pouring over them one pint boiling
water; let stand three minutes. Drain and cover with cold water. Remove
the skins and dry the almonds on a towel. Fry in hot butter. Drain on
brown paper, and sprinkle with salt.

CARAMELS.

One cupful of molasses, one half cupful of milk, one cupful of sugar,
one teaspoonful of flour, one tablespoonful of butter, one fourth pound
of chocolate; boil until it will harden when dropped in cold water,
then add a few drops of glycerine and one teaspoonful of vanilla; turn
into a buttered pan, when partly cool, mark in squares.


COFFEE CREAM CARAMELS.

Melt two pounds of sugar with as little water as possible; when the
sugar begins to bubble, pour in slowly one teacupful of rich cream and
stir carefully; add two ounces of fresh butter and the extract from two
ounces of coffee, stirring gently and continuously while adding. As
soon as cooked sufficiently to be brittle when dropped in cold water,
pour into buttered tin dish, and when nearly cooled, mark off with a
buttered knife into squares.


CHOCOLATE CARAMELS.

Cream together one teacupful of sugar with half the quantity of butter;
add one fourth of a pound of grated chocolate and one teacupful each of
molasses and milk. Beat well together and boil until a portion of it
dropped in ice-water sets and cracks. Pour into well buttered tin pans
to the thickness of half an inch. When nearly cold mark into squares
with a buttered knife.


LEMON CANDY.

Put one pound of sugar into a pan or kettle with half a pint of water
and a third of a teaspoonful of cream of tartar; let it boil, and when
a little of it dropped in cold water becomes brittle it is done; pour
into a shallow buttered dish. When cooled sufficiently to be handled
add one third of a teaspoonful of tartaric acid with the same quantity
of extract of lemon, and work thoroughly into the candy until the acid
has been evenly distributed. If worked too much the transparency of the
candy may be destroyed.


COCOANUT DROPS.

Grate one cocoanut and add to it one half its weight in sugar and the
white of an egg whipped to a stiff froth. Mix all together thoroughly
and drop on buttered white paper in a pan. Bake for fifteen minutes.


KISSES.

Beat the whites of four eggs to a stiff froth and stir in half a pound
of confectioner’s sugar, flavor with one half teaspoonful of vanilla.
Whip thoroughly and then drop in quantities about half the size of an
egg on buttered paper, well separated; lay the paper on a half inch
board and place in moderate oven. Watch carefully and when they begin
to color take them out, remove from paper and join them in pairs by
their flat surfaces.




                              BEVERAGES.


TEA.

Tea should be made with the little filagree silver balls that come
especially for that purpose. Fill ball with best quality Oolong, or
English Breakfast, tea that you can obtain (cheap teas are injurious
and tasteless). Have a pot of boiling water, fill your cup and then
immerse the tea ball in cup until the strength desired is obtained.
Serve with sugar and sliced lemon, after the Russian fashion; it is
more wholesome than with cream.


COCOA.

Allow one teaspoonful of cocoa and sugar to one cupful of milk and
water, in equal proportions. Heat the milk in double boiler. Put the
water in the cocoa pot, when it boils stir in the dry cocoa, mix well.
After boiling three minutes, add the hot milk. Serve when it begins to
rise in the pot.


FRENCH COFFEE.

Three pints of water to one cupful of ground coffee. Put coffee in
bowl; pour over it about half pint cold water and let stand for fifteen
minutes; bring remaining water to a boil. Take coffee in bowl, strain
through fine sieve, then take French coffee pot, put coffee grounds in
strainer at top of French pot, leaving water in bowl. Then take boiling
water and pour over coffee very slowly. Then set coffee-pot on stove
for five minutes; do not let boil. Take off and pour in cold water from
bowl that coffee was first soaked in, to settle. Serve in another pot.
The French, who have the reputation of making the best coffee, use
three parts Java to one part of Mocha.


AMERICAN COFFEE.

Allow one tablespoonful of ground coffee to each cupful of water used;
mix coffee with half the white of one egg; add one cupful of cold water
and shake well, then add as many more cupfuls of cold water as you have
allowed for. Place on back of range and steep ten minutes, then bring
forward. Let come to a boil. Settle with one half cupful of cold water.


CARAMEL COFFEE.

To prepare, take three and one half quarts of bran, add one and one
half quarts of corn meal, one pint of molasses, one half pint of
boiling water, mix well, and bake, stirring often. Make the same as
“American Coffee,” only let boil a little longer.


CHOCOLATE.

Melt dry, over steam, one half cake of sweet chocolate; bring to a
scald one quart of rich milk, add one cupful of sugar, turn into a
heated bowl, then add the melted chocolate and whip with egg beater
until chocolate is thoroughly dissolved in the milk. The longer it is
whipped the better it will be. Serve with whipped cream.


APRICOT WATER.

Skin twelve apricots, take out the stones, pour on one quart of boiling
water; allow them to stew for one hour, then strain off the clear
liquid and sweeten with three ounces of sugar.


GINGERADE.

Gingerade is made of any fruit, stewed with pulverized ginger, flavored
with lemon juice, and carefully strained.


GRAPE JUICE.

Wash and remove from stems ten pounds of grapes, put over to boil with
two quarts of water. Let boil until seeds and pulp separate. Strain
through cheese cloth bag, let it drain slowly, do not squeeze. Put
juice back in kettle, let come to a boil, and add one and one fourth
pounds of sugar; boil two or three minutes. Seal boiling hot. The
secret of success in bottling grape juice is to have everything boiling
hot, jars, juice, rubbers, and tops. The best way is to have jars in
kettle of boiling water right on the stove and tops in boiling water,
likewise, and fill right from kettle of boiling juice on the stove.
Then if your cans are air-tight the juice will surely keep.


FRUIT JUICES.

The following rules hold good for any kind of fruit: Crush the small
fruits raw, strain, add one half pound of sugar to each quart of
juice, let boil one minute, and bottle, using same precautions as those
specified in receipt for grape juice.


PINEAPPLE FRAPPÉ.

Boil one quart of water, one pint of sugar, and one pint of chopped
pineapple for twenty minutes; add one cupful of orange juice and one
half cupful of lemon juice. Freeze soft.


ORANGE FRAPPÉ.

Make a syrup by boiling one quart of water and one pint of sugar for
twenty minutes; add one pint of orange juice and the juice of two
lemons; one cupful of candied cherries should be added just before
freezing. Freeze soft.




                          ENGLISH MARMALADES.


RHUBARB MARMALADE.

Peel and cut into inch pieces tender young rhubarb, to every pint allow
one pound of loaf sugar and three oranges. Spread the cut rhubarb on a
shallow dish and cover with the sugar; leave it for twelve hours; then
put it into the preserving kettle with the grated yellow rind of the
oranges (be careful not to use any of the white pulp or it will make
the preserve bitter), add the tender, juicy pulp of the oranges and
boil slowly for about one hour, or until jam sets when tested on a cold
plate.


ORANGE MARMALADE.

To every pound of sliced oranges (one half Seville and one half
sweet) add three pints of cold water; let stand in a cool place for
forty-eight hours; then boil all together until tender, generally about
two hours; set away for twenty-four hours. Then weigh the fruit and to
every pound of the boiled fruit add three fourths of a pound of sugar.
Boil until it will “set” when tried on a chilled plate.


LEMON MARMALADE.

Pour a scant quart of boiling water over two pounds of sugar and let
it stand until dissolved. Put in agate preserving kettle and peel
some very thin, thread-like strips of the delicate yellow rind of
the lemons; add to the liquid; carefully peel and remove all fibrous
parts from six large lemons, collect the seeds, tying them in a thin
cloth; add the pulp and the little bag of seeds to syrup, keep kettle
uncovered and let preserve boil gently. When it “sets” on a chilled
plate it is done. The seeds used in this way make it jell much more
quickly and the marmalade is more delicate in flavor.


APRICOT MARMALADE.

Choose deep yellow apricots, not too ripe; take off the skin, take out
the stones, and extract the kernel. To each twelve pounds of fruit
add eight pounds of sugar, put in agate kettle, and boil until it
will “set” by dropping into a chilled plate. It needs to be stirred
frequently and carefully watched to prevent burning.




                           INVALID COOKERY.


PEA SOUP.

One pint of fresh, or one can of marrowfat peas; boil until thoroughly
soft so they will mash easily; then strain through a sieve to remove
skins. To pulp and liquor add one pint of cream, one teaspoonful of
sugar, salt and pepper to taste, and one tablespoonful of butter.
Serve with wafers. This is a very nutritious and relishable soup for a
convalescent.


MILK TOAST.

Brown delicately a thin slice of stale bread, cut in strips and
place in bowl; to one cupful of rich milk, brought to a scald, add a
teaspoonful of butter, have ready one heaping teaspoonful of flour
blended with water, strain into scalding milk and stir until it
thickens, set back and let cook gently while you whip the white of one
egg to a stiff froth, add a pinch of salt, then take the simmering milk
from the stove and whip the beaten white of egg in quickly. Pour over
toast in bowl and serve at once.


CUP CUSTARD.

Allow one egg and three fourths of a cupful of rich milk for each cup,
sweeten to taste and flavor with grated nutmeg, or vanilla extract,
as you prefer, pour in cups, set cup in shallow tin half filled with
water, and place in oven; bake until solid, and knife blade can be
drawn out clean. Cooking in the pan of water prevents custards from
separating and becoming watery.


RICE FOAM.

Wash one heaping teaspoonful of rice and cook until thoroughly tender
in milk; mash through a sieve; add pinch of salt; heat a half cupful of
cream to a scald, and stir in the rice. Whip the white of one egg to a
stiff froth, and add immediately on removing from the stove. A bit of
chopped parsley may be added, if liked. Serve with wafers. This is a
pleasant change from sweet gruels, and is very nutritious.


CREAMED GRUEL.

Cook one tablespoonful of rolled oats in scant pint of water; when soft
strain through a sieve; add one half cupful of cream; salt to taste,
and let come to a scald. Have ready the whites of two eggs beaten to
a stiff froth, take gruel from the fire and whip in the eggs, sweeten
to taste and flavor with a dash of nutmeg or a few drops of vanilla
extract.


EGG GRUEL.

Heat a cupful of milk to 180 F., and stir into it one well beaten egg
mixed with one fourth cupful of cold water. Stir constantly for a few
minutes until thickened, but do not allow it to boil again. Season with
salt, or if preferred, a little loaf sugar.


BARLEY GRUEL.

Wash three tablespoonfuls of pearl barley, drop it into a pint of
boiling water and parboil five minutes. Pour the water off and add
one quart of fresh boiling water, let it simmer gently from one to
three hours, strain, season, and serve. A small piece of lemon rind
added to the gruel one half hour before it is done will give an
agreeable flavor. Equal quantities of barley gruel and milk make a very
nourishing drink; a little lemon juice with sugar to taste is sometimes
liked as the flavor for the gruel.


ARROWROOT.

Mix two tablespoonfuls of arrowroot with four tablespoonfuls of cold
water; add half a pint of boiling water and boil until it thickens;
sweeten to taste and add a little grated nutmeg.


GRAHAM GRUEL.

Mix one tablespoonful of graham meal in four tablespoonfuls of cold
water, stir it into a pint of boiling water, cook twenty minutes, salt
to taste, and boil ten minutes longer, put a gill of thin gruel into a
cup with one half gill of milk or cream, and serve hot.


EGG NOGG.

Beat the yolk of a freshly laid egg with a tablespoonful of sugar until
it is light and creamy, add to this one half cupful of milk (hot or
cold, as you wish the drink, warm, or chilled), whip in, lightly, the
white of the egg, beaten stiff, a light grating of nutmeg, and if
mixed cold, a tablespoonful of cracked ice. Serve at once.


EGG AND LIME WATER.

To a wineglass full of lime water, add the stiffly beaten white of one
egg. Give this often, in small quantities, to patient. It is excellent
in cases of obstinate vomiting and bowel trouble.


APPLE WATER.

Wash and wipe a large sour apple and, without paring, cut it into thin
slices. Put them in a bowl with one strip of lemon peel, add one cupful
of boiling water, cover and set away to cool, strain when cold, sweeten
and serve with cracked ice. Cranberries or rhubarb may be used in the
same way.


EGG LEMONADE.

Beat the white of an egg to a stiff froth, mix with it the juice of a
small lemon and one tablespoonful of sugar. Add one cupful of ice water
and shake thoroughly.


ARROWROOT WATER.

Boil the thin rind of a fresh lemon in one quart of water. When
boiling, pour over one tablespoonful of arrowroot previously mixed with
a little cold water, stir well, sweeten to taste, and let it boil for
five minutes; squeeze in the juice of one lemon.


BARLEY WATER.

One teaspoonful of pearl barley, one half lemon, one quart boiling
water, sugar to taste. Wash the barley in cold water, add boiling
water, juice of lemon, a bit of rind, let stand, covered, and warm for
three hours.


EGG TEA.

Take the white of one egg and beat it to a stiff froth, beat the yolk
into it with a scant tablespoonful of sugar, then pour in slowly
(beating the mixture all the time) half a cupful of hot milk; flavor
with grated nutmeg or vanilla to taste.


TOAST WATER.

Brown nicely in the oven slices of bread, and pour upon them sufficient
boiling water to cover. Let them steep until cold, keeping the bowl or
dish containing the toast closely covered. Strain off the water and
sweeten to taste. Chill by setting dish in bowl of chopped ice.


BARLEY WATER.

Put two ounces of pearl barley into half a pint of boiling water and
let it simmer a few minutes. Drain off and add two quarts of boiling
water with a few figs and stoned raisins cut fine. Boil slowly until
reduced about one half and strain. Sweeten to taste, adding the juice
of a lemon and nutmeg if desired.


BAKED MILK.

Put the milk in a jar, covering the opening with white paper, and bake
in a moderate oven until thick as cream. May be taken by the most
delicate stomach.


FLAXSEED LEMONADE.

Pour on four tablespoonfuls of whole flaxseed one quart of boiling
water and add the juice of two lemons. Let it steep for three hours,
keeping it closely covered. Strain and sweeten to taste.




                           IMPORTANT NOTES.


THE WAY TO TEST HOT FAT.

If a bit of dry bread will brown in one minute fat is hot enough for a
raw mixture. If cooked mixtures are to be browned the fat should be hot
enough to brown a piece of bread in forty seconds. This method however,
is only a makeshift and is not absolutely accurate. A thermometer
should be used; 380 to 390 degrees is the right temperature for frying
vegetable substances. Heat fat slowly.


CELERY FLAVORING.

Clean the green stalks and leaves of celery and dry, place in paper
bags to be used for soups and savories when celery is out of season.
This can be used in place of the celery seed called for in some
receipts.


NUT BUTTER.

Peanuts shelled and well roasted with the skins rubbed off will, when
ground, dissolve into a buttery substance which can be spread on bread
and made into sandwiches. All kinds of nuts reduced to flour can be
readily digested and can be placed on the table to be eaten with bread
or spread on sandwiches.


BAY LEAVES.

Bay leaves contribute a most delicate and pungent flavor to soups,
savories and gravies. They can be obtained at any druggist’s, and five
cents worth will last a long time.




        SUBSTITUTES FOR INGREDIENTS IN NON-VEGETARIAN RECEIPTS.


SUET.

In place of suet use bread crumbs soaked in oil or butter.


MEATS.

Use nuts as substitute for meats. To prepare the nuts for cooking, pick
from the shell carefully and chop very fine, or better yet, grind in
nut mill.


GELATINE.

In place of gelatine, use Irish Moss or corn starch.


MEAT FATS.

Nut butter takes the place of meat extract and fats in gravies and
sauces. Where plain butter is preferred with a savory flavoring of
herbs, always brown the flour used for thickening.


PASTRY.

Cocoanut or cow’s butter is the substitute for lard or cotoline in
vegetarian pastry.


HERBS.

The value of herbs for savories and soups is too little understood by
American cooks. Here is “Aunt Susan’s” receipt for a “soup powder” that
will flavor any soup, gravy, or savory dish with a fine flavor:


SOUP POWDER.

  Sweet Marjoram--Powdered, two ounces.
  Parsley--Powdered, two ounces.
  Summer Savory--Powdered, two ounces.
  Thyme--Powdered, two ounces.
  Bay Leaf--Powdered, two ounces.
  Lemon Peel--Powdered, one ounce.
  Sweet Basil--Powdered, one ounce.
  Rosemary--Powdered, one ounce.


TO PREPARE ONIONS FOR SALADS OR FILLINGS.

Peel and slice, or chop, cover the onions with boiling water, and let
stand three or four minutes, drain and put in ice water, let stand ten
or fifteen minutes, or, until crisp. The onions are just as crisp as
before, and much more delicate.


THE WAY TO DRY CORN.

Just scald, then cut from the cob, put in a pan and set over kettle
of boiling water; stir frequently, and in a couple of hours the corn
will be almost dry, if the water in kettle has been constantly kept at
boiling. Set in warm oven half an hour and the corn is ready to put in
bags; dry and clean.


WEIGHTS AND MEASURES FOR COOKS.

  1 pound of wheat flour is equal to                  1 quart
  1 pound and two ounces of Indian meal make          1 quart
  1 pound of soft butter is equal to                  1 quart
  1 pound and 2 ounces of best brown sugar make       1 quart
  1 pound and 1 ounce of powdered white sugar make    1 quart
  1 pound of broken loaf sugar is equal to            1 quart
  4 large tablespoonfuls make                        ¹⁄₂ gill
  1 common-sized tumbler holds                       ¹⁄₂ pint
  1 common-sized wine glass is equal to              ¹⁄₂ gill
  1 tea-cup holds                                      1 gill

  1 tablespoonful is equal to                       ¹⁄₂ ounce


COLORING FOR SAUCES AND SOUPS.

Crush a quarter of a pound of loaf sugar to powder, put it into a
sauce pan with a tablespoonful of water, and stir it unceasingly over
a gentle fire until it begins to acquire a little color. Draw it back
and bake it very slowly, still stirring it, until it is almost black,
without being in the least burnt. It will take about half an hour. Pour
a quart of water over it, let it boil for a few minutes until the sugar
is quite dissolved, pour it out, and when cold, strain it into a bottle
and store it for use. A tablespoonful of this browning will color half
a pint of liquid.


BOILING VEGETABLES.

It is very essential for health that all the properties of food should
be retained in the cooking, therefore the habit of boiling the various
vegetables, in an unnecessary quantity of water, and then draining this
down the sink, is a means of defrauding the organism of the nourishment
originally contained in the article.

Potatoes, carrots, parsnips, and other articles requiring their skins
to be removed for serving or mincing, should, when possible, be steamed
“in their jackets” and peeled as much as necessary afterwards.

Cauliflowers, cabbage, &c., are excellent when steamed. Green peas,
beans, and such, should be put in a covered vessel, with a little
butter, and, when necessary, a spoonful or two of water, and gently
stewed, standing inside a saucepan of water without the water touching
them; or they can be stewed in the oven in an earthenware jar, with a
little butter and a spoonful or two of water. This method of cooking
takes very little longer time than the ordinary boiling in water. The
oven should be moderately heated.


STEWING FRUITS.

Fruits are better stewed in a double enamelled saucepan, or baked in
a tightly covered earthen jar in the oven with as little water as
possible.

Dried fruits, such as raisins, figs, dates, &c., should be washed and
picked over carefully, then soaked for several hours in cold water till
they are soft and swollen to their fullest extent, when they should be
stewed in the same water.


USE OF SALT.

As little salt as is palatable should be used, and an effort made to
daily lessen its use. When once the system is freed from the use of
this mineral in its daily food, a small dose shows it to be an active
poison. There is enough of natural salts in our vegetable foods without
our making use of the mineral deposit. Knowing that many will use this
book who are just turning from the meat diet, we give, as a rule, the
usual quantity of salt in the receipts used in ordinary cookery. For
the same reason we give the ordinary beverages in daily use, in the
menus.


BEVERAGES.

Fruit juices are far more conductive to good health than tea or coffee,
and we especially recommend lemon juice diluted with boiling water as
a breakfast beverage, though we have not ventured to place it on the
regular bill of fare. It is a most appetising morning drink, and should
be taken a short time before eating.

                                 FOOD.

Its chief contention is that the fruits, nuts and grains, with a fair
proportion of fresh and preserved vegetable productions (with or
without the products of animals), are wholesome and pure. That flesh
meat contains the germs of diseases to which animals are subject and
contain the thick, venous blood, a substance so poisonous that it will
cause blood poisoning whenever it comes in contact with the arterial
blood of the body. That by avoiding the butcher’s meat and living
on the pure foods provided so abundantly in the Vegetable kingdom a
higher degree of health and strength can be obtained; a longer life and
greater freedom from irritation and nervous exhaustion, under pressure
of business or professional labor.

The principles of humanity towards animals and the effects of pure food
in promoting man’s ethical and spiritual progress are also discussed in
this magazine.

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the
United States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg™ electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG™
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away--you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark
license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg™ mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase “Project
Gutenberg”), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg™ License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg™ electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg™
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg™ electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. “Project Gutenberg” is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg™ electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg™
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (“the
Foundation” or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg™ mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg™
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg™ name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg™ License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg™ work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg™ License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg™ work (any work
on which the phrase “Project Gutenberg” appears, or with which the
phrase “Project Gutenberg” is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you will have to check the laws of the country where
  you are located before using this eBook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg™ electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase “Project
Gutenberg” associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg™
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg™ electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg™ License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg™
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg™.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg™ License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg™ work in a format
other than “Plain Vanilla ASCII” or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg™ website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original “Plain
Vanilla ASCII” or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg™ License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg™ works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
provided that:

• You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg™ works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg™ trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, “Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation.”

• You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg™
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg™
  works.

• You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

• You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg™ works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the manager of
the Project Gutenberg™ trademark. Contact the Foundation as set
forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg™ collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the “Right
of Replacement or Refund” described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg™ trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you “AS-IS”, WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg™ work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg™ work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™

Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™'s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,
Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up
to date contact information can be found at the Foundation's website
and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without
widespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
